,For the political term, see ,Benevolent dictatorship,.,
,Benevolent dictator for life, (,BDFL,) is a title given to a small number of ,open-source software development, leaders, typically project founders who retain the final say in disputes or arguments within the community. The phrase originated in 1995 with reference to ,Guido van Rossum,, creator of the ,Python programming language,,,[1],[2], while in 2018, Van Rossum stepped down as the leader in the language community after 30 years.
,Shortly after Van Rossum joined the ,Corporation for National Research Initiatives,, the term appeared in a follow-up mail by ,Ken Manheimer, to a meeting trying to create a semi-formal group that would oversee Python development and workshops; this initial use included the additional joke of naming Van Rossum the ""First Interim BDFL"".,[1], Van Rossum announced on July 12, 2018, that he would be stepping down from BDFL of Python.,[3],
,BDFL should not be confused with the more common term for open-source leaders, "",benevolent dictator,"", which was popularized by ,Eric S. Raymond,'s essay "",Homesteading the Noosphere,"" (1999).,[4], Among other topics related to ,hacker culture,, Raymond elaborates on how the nature of open source forces the ""dictatorship"" to keep itself benevolent, since a strong disagreement can lead to the ,forking, of the project under the rule of new leaders.

,This article is about the class of text editors. For the most popular current example, see ,GNU Emacs,.,
,Emacs,Editing multiple ,Dired, buffers in ,GNU Emacs,Developer(s),David A. Moon,Guy L. Steele Jr.,Richard M. Stallman,Initial release,1976,; 42 years ago, (,1976,),[1],[2],Stable release,26.1 ,(May 28, 2018,; 6 months ago, (,2018-05-28,),), ,[±],

,Emacs, ,/,ˈ,iː,m,æ,k,s,/, is a family of ,text editors, that are characterized by their ,extensibility,.,[3], The manual for the most widely used variant,,[4], ,GNU Emacs,, describes it as ""the extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor"".,[5],  Development of the first Emacs began in the mid-1970s, and work on its direct descendant, GNU Emacs, continues actively as of  2018,[update],.
,Emacs has over 10,000 built-in commands (many of which are macros themselves) and its ,user interface, allows the user to combine these commands into ,macros, to automate work. Implementations of Emacs typically feature a dialect of the ,Lisp, programming language that provides a deep extension capability, allowing users and developers to write new commands and applications for the editor. Extensions have been written to ,manage email,, ,files,, ,outlines,, and ,RSS, feeds,,[6], as well as clones of ,ELIZA,, ,Pong,, ,Conway's Life,, ,Snake, and ,Tetris,.,[7],
,The original EMACS was written in 1976 by ,Carl Mikkelsen,, ,David A. Moon, and ,Guy L. Steele Jr., as a set of ,Editor MACroS, for the ,TECO, editor.,[2],[8],[9],[10],[11], It was inspired by the ideas of the TECO-macro editors TECMAC and TMACS.,[12],
,The most popular, and most ported, version of Emacs is GNU Emacs, which was created by ,Richard Stallman, for the ,GNU Project,.,[13], ,XEmacs, is a variant that ,branched, from GNU Emacs in 1991. GNU Emacs and XEmacs use similar Lisp dialects and are for the most part compatible with each other.
,Emacs is, along with ,vi,, one of the two main contenders in the traditional ,editor wars, of ,Unix, culture. Emacs is among the oldest ,free and open source, projects still under development.,[14],

,History,[,edit,],
,  ,Editing ,C, ,source code, in ,GNU Emacs,
,  ,Editing, compiling and executing ,C++, code from ,GNU Emacs,
,  ,The interface of Emacs was influenced by the design of the ,Symbolics, ,space-cadet keyboard,[15],
,Emacs development began during the 1970s at the ,MIT AI Lab,, whose ,PDP-6, and ,PDP-10, computers used the ,Incompatible Timesharing System, (ITS) ,operating system, that featured a default ,line editor, known as ,Tape Editor and Corrector, (TECO). Unlike most modern text editors, TECO used separate modes in which the user would either add text, edit existing text, or display the document. One could not place characters directly into a document by typing them into TECO, but would instead enter a character ('i') in the TECO command language telling it to switch to input mode, enter the required characters, during which time the edited text was not displayed on the screen, and finally enter a character (<esc>) to switch the editor back to command mode. (A similar technique was used to allow overtyping.) This behavior is similar to that of the program ,ed,.
,Richard Stallman, visited the ,Stanford AI Lab, in 1972 or 1974 and saw the lab's ,E, editor, written by Fred Wright.,[16], He was impressed by the editor's intuitive ,WYSIWYG, (What You See Is What You Get) behavior, which has since become the default behavior of most modern text editors. He returned to MIT where Carl Mikkelsen, a ,hacker, at the AI Lab, had added to TECO a combined display/editing mode called ,Control-R, that allowed the screen display to be updated each time the user entered a keystroke. Stallman reimplemented this mode to run efficiently and then added a ,macro, feature to the TECO display-editing mode that allowed the user to redefine any keystroke to run a TECO program.,[10],
,E had another feature that TECO lacked: random-access editing. TECO was a page-sequential editor that was designed for editing ,paper tape, on the ,PDP-1, and typically allowed editing on only one page at a time, in the order of the pages in the file. Instead of adopting E's approach of structuring the file for page-random access on disk, Stallman modified TECO to handle large buffers more efficiently and changed its file-management method to read, edit, and write the entire file as a single buffer. Almost all modern editors use this approach.
,The new version of TECO quickly became popular at the AI Lab and soon accumulated a large collection of custom macros whose names often ended in ,MAC, or ,MACS,, which stood for ,macro,. Two years later, ,Guy Steele, took on the project of unifying the diverse macros into a single set.,[17], Steele and Stallman's finished implementation included facilities for extending and documenting the new macro set.,[10], The resulting system was called EMACS, which stood for ,Editing MACroS, or, alternatively, ,E with MACroS,. Stallman picked the name Emacs ""because <E> was not in use as an abbreviation on ITS at the time."",[18], An apocryphal ,hacker koan, alleges that the program was named after ,Emack & Bolio's,, a popular ,Cambridge, ice cream store.,[19], The first operational EMACS system existed in late 1976.,[20],
,Stallman saw a problem in too much customization and ,de facto, forking and set certain conditions for usage.,[,citation needed,], He later wrote:,[20],
,
,""EMACS was distributed on a basis of communal sharing, which means all improvements must be given back to me to be incorporated and distributed."",
,The original Emacs, like TECO, ran only on the PDP-10 running ITS. Its behavior was sufficiently different from that of TECO that it could be considered a text editor in its own right, and it quickly became the standard editing program on ITS. ,Mike McMahon, ,ported, Emacs from ITS to the ,TENEX, and ,TOPS-20, operating systems. Other contributors to early versions of Emacs include ,Kent Pitman,, ,Earl Killian,, and ,Eugene Ciccarelli,. By 1979, Emacs was the main editor used in MIT's AI lab and its Laboratory for Computer Science.,[21],
,
,Other early implementations,[,edit,],
,In the following years, programmers wrote a variety of Emacs-like editors for other computer systems. These included ,EINE, (,EINE Is Not EMACS,) and ,ZWEI,[22], (,ZWEI Was EINE Initially,), which were written for the ,Lisp machine, by ,Mike McMahon, and ,Daniel Weinreb,, and Sine (,Sine Is Not Eine,),,[23], which was written by Owen Theodore Anderson. Weinreb's ,EINE, was the first Emacs written in Lisp. In 1978, ,Bernard Greenberg, wrote ,Multics Emacs, almost entirely in Multics Lisp at ,Honeywell,'s Cambridge Information Systems Lab. Multics Emacs was later maintained by ,Richard Soley,, who went on to develop the NILE Emacs-like editor for the NIL Project, and by Barry Margolin. Many versions of Emacs, including GNU Emacs, would later adopt Lisp as an extension language.
,James Gosling,, who would later invent ,NeWS, and the ,Java programming language,, wrote ,Gosling Emacs, in 1981. The first Emacs-like editor to run on ,Unix,, Gosling Emacs was written in ,C, and used ,Mocklisp,, a language with Lisp-like syntax, as an extension language.
,
,GNU Emacs,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,GNU Emacs,

,  ,GNU Emacs running on ,Microsoft Windows,
,Richard Stallman began work on GNU Emacs in 1984 to produce a ,free software, alternative to the proprietary Gosling Emacs. GNU Emacs was initially based on Gosling Emacs, but Stallman's replacement of its Mocklisp interpreter with a true Lisp interpreter required that nearly all of its code be rewritten. This became the first program released by the nascent GNU Project. GNU Emacs is written in C and provides ,Emacs Lisp,, also implemented in C, as an extension language. Version 13, the first public release, was made on March 20, 1985. The first widely distributed version of GNU Emacs was version 15.34, released later in 1985. Early versions of GNU Emacs were numbered as ,1.x.x,, with the initial digit denoting the version of the C core. The ,1, was dropped after version 1.12, as it was thought that the major number would never change, and thus the numbering skipped from ,1, to ,13,.,[24], In September 2014, it was announced on the GNU emacs-devel mailing list that GNU Emacs would adopt a ,rapid release, strategy and version numbers would increment more quickly in the future.,[25],
,GNU Emacs was later ported to Unix. It offered more features than Gosling Emacs, in particular a full-featured Lisp as its extension language, and soon replaced Gosling Emacs as the ,de facto, Unix Emacs editor. ,Markus Hess, exploited a security flaw in GNU Emacs' email subsystem in his 1986 cracking spree in which he gained ,superuser, access to Unix computers.,[26],
,GNU Emacs uses a layered architecture, with a ,Turing complete, language running on top of a smaller central core.  Because about 70% of GNU Emacs is written in the Elisp extension language,,[27], and the set of features implemented in Elisp code are automatically present once the C core (which implements the Elisp interpreter, weighing 247 kLOC as of version 24.4) has been ported, porting Emacs to a new platform is considerably less difficult than porting an equivalent project consisting of native code only.  Theoretically, only the core must be ported to the new platform; once the core is ported, the portions implemented in the language above take minimal work to bring over.
,GNU Emacs development was relatively closed until 1999 and was used as an example of the ,Cathedral, development style in ,The Cathedral and the Bazaar,. The project has since adopted a public development mailing list and anonymous ,CVS, access. Development took place in a single CVS trunk until 2008 and was then switched to the Bazaar ,DVCS,. On November 11, 2014, development was moved to ,Git,.,[28],
,Richard Stallman has remained the principal maintainer of GNU Emacs, but he has stepped back from the role at times. Stefan Monnier and Chong Yidong were maintainers from 2008-2015.,[29],[30], John Wiegley was named maintainer in 2015 after a meeting with Stallman at MIT.,[31], As of early 2014, GNU Emacs has had 579 individual ,committers, throughout its history.,[32],
,
,XEmacs,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,XEmacs,
,  ,XEmacs, 21.5 on ,GNU,/,Linux,
,Lucid Emacs, based on an early alpha version of GNU Emacs 19, was developed beginning in 1991 by ,Jamie Zawinski, and others at ,Lucid Inc., One of the best-known early forks in ,free software, development occurred when the codebases of the two Emacs versions diverged and the separate development teams ceased efforts to merge them back into a single program.,[33], Lucid Emacs has since been renamed ,XEmacs, and remains the second most popular variety of Emacs, after GNU Emacs.,[,citation needed,], XEmacs development has slowed, with the most recent stable version 21.4.22 released in January 2009 (while a beta was released in 2013), while GNU Emacs has implemented many formerly XEmacs-only features. This has led some users to proclaim XEmacs' death.,[34],
,
,Other forks of GNU Emacs,[,edit,],
,Other forks, less known than XEmacs, include:
,
,Remacs – a port of GNU Emacs to the ,Rust, programming language.,[35],
,Meadow, – a Japanese version for Microsoft Windows,[36],
,SXEmacs, – Steve Youngs' fork of XEmacs,[37],
,Aquamacs, – based on GNU Emacs (Aquamacs 3.2 is based on GNU Emacs version 24 and Aquamacs 3.3 is based on GNU Emacs version 25) which focuses on integrating with the Apple Macintosh user interface,
,Various Emacs editors,[,edit,],
,  ,The ,mg, tiny Emacs-like editor in ,OpenBSD, 5.3. Editing ,Ruby, ,source code,
,  ,Zmacs,, an Emacs for ,Lisp machines,
,In the past, projects aimed at producing small versions of Emacs proliferated. GNU Emacs was initially targeted at computers with a 32-bit flat address space and at least 1 ,MiB, of RAM.  Such computers were high end ,workstations, and ,minicomputers, in the 1980s, and this left a need for smaller reimplementations that would run on common ,personal computer, hardware.  In more recent times, small clones have been designed to fit on software installation disks.,[,citation needed,],
,Other projects aim to implement Emacs in a different dialect of Lisp or a different programming language altogether.  Although not all are still actively maintained, these clones include:
,
,MicroEMACS,, which was originally written by Dave Conroy and further developed by Daniel Lawrence and which exists in many variations.,
,mg,, originally called MicroGNUEmacs and, later, mg2a, a public-domain offshoot of MicroEMACS intended to more closely resemble GNU Emacs. Now installed by default on ,OpenBSD,.,
,NotGNU,,[38], a small, fast, proprietary ,freeware, implementation for DOS, Win16, Win32 and Linux by Julie Melbin.,
,JOVE, (Jonathan's Own Version of Emacs), Jonathan Payne's non-programmable Emacs implementation for ,UNIX-like, systems.,
,MINCE, (MINCE Is Not Complete Emacs), a version for CP/M and later DOS, from ,Mark of the Unicorn,. MINCE evolved into Final Word, which eventually became the Borland ,Sprint, word processor.,
,Perfect Writer,, a ,CP/M, implementation derived from MINCE that was included circa 1982 as the default word processor with the very earliest releases of the Kaypro II and Kaypro IV. It was later provided with the Kaypro 10 as an alternative to ,WordStar,.,
,Freemacs,, a ,DOS, version that uses an extension language based on text macro expansion and fits within the original 64 ,KiB, flat memory limit.,
,Zile,. Zile was a recursive acronym for ,Z,ile ,I,s ,L,ossy, ,E,macs,,,[39], but the project was rewritten in ,Lua, and now gives the expansion as Zile Implements Lua Editors. The new Zile still includes an implementation of Emacs in Lua called Zemacs. There is also an implementation of vi called Zi.,

,GNOME Builder, has an emulation mode for Emacs.,
,Features,[,edit,],
,Emacs is primarily a ,text editor, and is designed for manipulating pieces of text, although it is capable of formatting and printing documents like a ,word processor, by interfacing with external programs such as ,LaTeX,, ,Ghostscript, or a web browser. Emacs provides commands to manipulate and ,differentially display, ,semantic, units of text such as ,words,, ,sentences,, ,paragraphs, and ,source code, constructs such as ,functions,. It also features ,keyboard macros, for performing user-defined batches of editing commands.
,GNU Emacs is a ,real-time display, editor, as its edits are displayed onscreen as they occur. This is standard behavior for modern text editors but EMACS was among the earliest to implement this functionality instead of having to issue a separate command to insert new edits into the existing text as in vi.
,
,General architecture,[,edit,],
,Almost all of the functionality in Emacs, including basic editing operations such as the insertion of characters into a document, is achieved through ,functions, written in ,Emacs Lisp, (ELisp), a dialect of the ,Lisp programming language,. The ELisp layer sits atop a stable core of basic services and platform abstraction written in the ,C programming language,. In this Lisp environment, ,variables, and ,functions, can be modified with no need to recompile or restart Emacs.
,Emacs operates on ,data structures, called ,buffers, containing text with additional attributes; every buffer maintains its own ,point, (cursor location) and ,mark, (another location, delimiting the selected ,region, together with the ,point,), the name of the file it is ,visiting, (if applicable) and the set of active ,modes, (exactly one ,major mode,[,clarification needed,], and any number of ,minor modes,[,clarification needed,],), which control editor behaviour through variables. Elisp code can be executed interactively through named ,commands,, which can be bound to key presses or accessed by name; some commands evaluate arbitrary Elisp code from buffers (e.g. ,eval-region, or ,eval-buffer,).
,Buffers are displayed in ,windows,, which are tiled portions of the terminal screen or the GUI window (called a ,frame, in Emacs terms; multiple frames are possible). Unless configured otherwise, windows include scroll bars, line numbers, a ,header line, at the top (usually displaying the buffer title or filename) and a ,mode line, at the bottom (usually listing the active modes and point position of the buffer).
,Multiple windows can be opened onto the same buffer, for example to see different parts of a long text, and multiple buffers can share the same text, for example to take advantage of different major modes in a mixed-language file. The mode can also be changed manually as needed with ,M-x <mode name>,.
,
,Customizability,[,edit,],
,Keystrokes can be recorded into macros and replayed to automate complex, repetitive tasks. This is often done on an ad-hoc basis, with each macro discarded after use, although macros can be saved and invoked later.,
,At startup, Emacs executes an Emacs Lisp script named ,~/.emacs, (recent versions also look for ,~/emacs.el, and ,~/.emacs.d/init.el,;,[48], Emacs will execute the first one it finds, ignoring the rest). This personal customization file can be arbitrarily long and complex, but typical content includes:
,Setting global variables or invoking functions to customize Emacs behaviour, for example ,(set-default-coding-systems 'utf-8),
,Key bindings, to override standard ones and to add shortcuts for commands that the user finds convenient but don't have a key binding by default. Example: ,(global-set-key (kbd ""C-x C-b"") 'ibuffer),
,Loading, enabling and initializing extensions (Emacs comes with many extensions, but only a few are loaded by default.),
,Configuring ,event hooks, to run arbitrary code at specific times, for example to automatically recompile source code after saving a buffer (,after-save-hook,),
,Executing arbitrary files, usually to split an overly long configuration file into manageable and homogeneous parts (,~/.emacs.d/, and ,~/elisp/, are traditional locations for these personal scripts),
,The ,customize, extension allows the user to set configuration properties such as the color scheme interactively, from within Emacs, in a more user-friendly way than by setting variables in ,.emacs,: it offers search, descriptions and help text, multiple choice inputs, reverting to defaults, modification of the running Emacs instance without reloading, and other conveniences similar to the ,preferences, functionality of other programs. The customized values are saved in ,.emacs, (or another designated file) automatically.,
,Themes,, affecting the choice of fonts and colours, are defined as elisp files and chosen through the customize extension.,
,Self-documenting,[,edit,],
,The first Emacs contained a ,help, library that included documentation for every command, variable and internal function. Because of this, Emacs proponents described the software as ,self-documenting, in that it presents the user with information on its normal features and its current state. Each function includes a documentation string that is displayed to the user on request, a practice that subsequently spread to programming languages including ,Lisp,, ,Java,, ,Perl,, and ,Python,. This help system can take users to the actual code for each function, whether from a built-in library or an added third-party library.
,Emacs also has a built-in ,tutorial,. Emacs displays instructions for performing simple editing commands and invoking the tutorial when it is launched with no file to edit. The tutorial is by Stuart Cracraft and Richard Stallman.
,
,Culture,[,edit,],
,Church of Emacs,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Editor war,
,  ,Richard Stallman, as St I,GNUcius,, a saint in the ,Church of Emacs,
,The ,Church of Emacs,, formed by ,Richard Stallman,, is a ,parody religion, created for Emacs users.,[49], While it refers to ,vi, as the ,editor of the beast, (vi-vi-vi being ,6-6-6, in Roman numerals), it does not oppose the use of vi; rather, it calls ,proprietary software, ,anathema,. (""Using a ,free, version of vi is not a sin but a ,penance,."",[50],) The Church of Emacs has its own ,newsgroup,, ,alt.religion.emacs,,,[51], that has posts purporting to support this parody religion. Supporters of vi have created an opposing ,Cult of vi,.
,Stallman has jokingly referred to himself as ,St I ,GNU, cius,, a saint in the Church of Emacs.,[52],
,
,Emacs pinky,[,edit,],
,There is folklore attributing a ,repetitive strain injury, colloquially called ,Emacs ,pinky, to Emacs' strong dependence on modifier keys,,[53], although there have not been any studies done to show Emacs causes more such problems than other keyboard-heavy computer programs.
,Users have addressed this through various approaches. Some users recommend simply using the two Control keys on typical PC keyboards like Shift keys while touch typing to avoid overly straining the left pinky.,[54], Software-side methods include:,[55],
,
,Customizing the key layout so that the Control key is transposed with the caps lock key.,[56], Similar techniques include defining the caps lock key as an additional Control key or transposing the Control and Meta keys.,This technique has also been specifically recommended ,against, as ,contributing, to Emacs pinky.,[,clarification needed,],
,Software, such as xwrits or the built-in ,type-break-mode, in Emacs, that reminds the user to take regularly scheduled breaks.,
,Using the ErgoEmacs keybindings (with minor mode ,ergoemacs-mode,).,[57],[58],
,Customizing the whole keyboard layout to move statistically frequent Emacs keys to more appropriate places.,[59],
,Packages such as ,ace-jump-mode,[60], or elisp extensions that provide similar functionality of tiered navigation, first asking for a character then replacing occurrences of the character with access keys for cursor movement.,
,evil-mode,, an advanced ,Vim, emulation layer.,
,god-mode,, which provides an approach similar to vim's with a mode for entering Emacs commands without modifier keys.,
,Using customized key layout offered by ,Spacemacs,, a project where ,Space, key is used as the main key for initiating control sequences. The project also heavily incorporates both ,evil-mode, and ,god-mode,.,[61],
,StickyKeys,, which turns key sequences into key combinations.,[62],
,Emacs' built-in ,viper-mode, that allows use of the ,vi, key layout for basic text editing and the Emacs scheme for more advanced features.,[63],
,Giving a dual role to a more-comfortably accessed key such as the ,Space bar, so that it functions as a Control key when pressed in combination with other keys. ,Ergonomic keyboards, or keyboards with a greater number of keys adjacent to the space bar, such as ,Japanese keyboards,, allow thumb control of other modifier keys too like Meta or Shift.,[64],
,Using a limited ergonomic subset of keybindings, and accessing other functionality by typing ,M-x <command-name>,. M-x itself can also be rebound.,
,Driving Emacs through voice input.,
,Hardware solutions include special keyboards such as ,Kinesis's Contoured Keyboard,, which places the modifier keys where they can easily be operated by the ,thumb,, or the ,Microsoft Natural keyboard,, whose large modifier keys are placed symmetrically on both sides of the keyboard and can be pressed with the palm of the hand.,[53], Foot pedals can also be used.
,The ,Emacs pinky, is a relatively recent development. The ,Space-cadet keyboard, on which Emacs was developed had oversized Control keys that were adjacent to the space bar and were easy to reach with the thumb.,[65],
,
,Terminology,[,edit,],
,The word ,emacs, is sometimes pluralized as ,emacsen,, by phonetic analogy with ,boxen, and ,VAXen,, referring to different varieties of Emacs.,[66],
,
,Emacs in popular culture,[,edit,],
,In the movie, ,The Internship (2013),, at 01:21:01, Nick Campbell asks, ""It occurred to me, why not use Emacs rather than vi as the default editor for Ubuntu?"" to which Dana replies, ""That's actually a very good thought, Nick."",[67],
,On the television series, ,Silicon Valley Season 3, episode 6,, Richard asks, ""I mean, why not just use Vim over Emacs?"", to which Winnie replies, ""I do use Vim over Emacs."", to which Richard responds, ""Oh, God, help us!"",[68],

,Programming,[,edit,],
,In 1999, Hansson founded and built a Danish online gaming news website and community called Daily Rush, which he ran until 2001.,[4], After attracting the attention of ,Jason Fried, by offering him help with PHP coding, Hansson was hired by Fried to build a web-based ,project management, tool, which ultimately became 37signals' ,Basecamp, ,software as a service, product.,[5], To aid the development process, Hansson used the then-obscure Ruby programming language to develop a custom ,web framework,. He released the framework separately from the project management tool in 2004 as the ,open source, project ,Ruby on Rails,. In 2005, Hansson was recognized by ,Google, and ,O'Reilly, with the ""Hacker of the Year"" award for his creation of Ruby on Rails.,[6], After graduating from the ,Copenhagen Business School, and receiving his ,bachelor's degree, in Computer Science and Business Administration, Hansson moved from ,Denmark, to ,Chicago,, Illinois, ,U.S., in November 2005.,[7],

,Dries Buytaert, (born 19 November 1978 in ,Wilrijk,, ,Antwerp,, ,Belgium,),[1], is an ,open-source software, ,programmer, notable as founder and lead developer of the ,Drupal, content management system.,[2],[3],[4],

,Career,[,edit,],
,Buytaert defended his PhD dissertation in ,Computer Science, on 27 January 2008,[5], at ,Ghent University, in Belgium.,[6],
,From 1999-2000 he was the maintainer of the ,Linux,-,WLAN, FAQ,.,[7],
,On 1 December 2007, Dries,[8], announced, together with co-founder ,Jay Batson, the launch of a start-up called ,Acquia,.,[9], Acquia is a commercial open-source software company providing products, services, and technical support for Drupal. Acquia wants to be to Drupal what ,Red Hat, has been to ,Linux,.,[10], In 2009, Acquia helped re-launch Whitehouse.gov on Drupal.,[11],
,On 31 March 2008, Dries launched ,Mollom,, a service dedicated to stopping website spam: ""Mollom's purpose is to dramatically reduce the effort of keeping your site clean and the quality of your content high. Currently, Mollom is a spam-killing one-two punch combination of a state-of-the-art spam filter and CAPTCHA server."" Over 59,000 websites are protected by the Mollom service,,[12], including all of ,Netlog,'s messages.,[13],
,In 2008, Buytaert was elected ""Young Entrepreneurs of Tech"" by ,BusinessWeek,.,[14], He was also named to the ,MIT, ,Technology Review, ,TR35, as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.,[15],[16],
,
,Dismissal of Larry Garfield,[,edit,],
,In March of 2017, Buytaert fired veteran Drupal developer Larry Garfield and disinvited him from DrupalCon, shortly after forum posts came to light that outed Garfield as a participant in the ,Gorean subculture,. In a March 22 blog post, Garfield accused Buytaert of tolerating ,doxing, and wrote that Drupal's Community Working Group had not found any Code of Conduct violations in his history.,[17], Buytaert made a post the next day which defended the firing as necessary for fostering an inclusive community. He also wrote that his precise reasoning was confidential and that he ""did not make the decision based on the information or beliefs conveyed in Larry's blog post."",[17], Several commentators disputed this characterization citing Buytaert's criticism of Gorean gender roles in the same post and the deleted sentence ""further participation in a leadership role implies our community is complicit with and/or endorses these views, which we do not."",[18], Garfield also stated that he was ignorant of other ""things not mentioned"" that could have led to his dismissal.,[19], 85 Drupal developers posted an open letter criticizing Buytaert for his handling of the situation with ,Jon Evans, describing it as a form of ,victim blaming,.,[17],[20],

,Ethereum, is an ,open-source,, ,public,, ,blockchain,-based ,distributed computing, platform and ,operating system, featuring ,smart contract, (scripting) functionality. It supports a modified version of ,Nakamoto, consensus via transaction-based state transitions.
,Ether, is a ,cryptocurrency, whose blockchain is generated by the Ethereum platform. ,Ether, can be transferred between accounts and used to compensate participant mining nodes for computations performed.,[3], Ethereum provides a decentralized ,virtual machine,, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which can execute scripts using an international network of public nodes. The virtual machine's ,instruction set,, in contrast to others like ,Bitcoin, ,Script,, is ,expressive, enough as languages like ,C, that it's said to be ,Turing-complete, in an informal sense. ""Gas"", an internal transaction pricing mechanism, is used to mitigate ,spam, and allocate resources on the network.
,Ethereum was proposed in late 2013 by ,Vitalik Buterin,, a cryptocurrency researcher and programmer. Development was funded by an online ,crowdsale, that took place between July and August 2014.
,The system went live on 30 July 2015, with 72 million coins ""premined"". 
This accounts for about 70 percent of the total circulating supply in 2018.
,In 2016, as a result of the exploitation of a flaw in ,The DAO, project's ,smart contract, software, and subsequent theft of $50 million worth of Ether,,[4], Ethereum was split into two separate blockchains – the new separate version became Ethereum (ETH) with the theft reversed,,[5], and the original continued as ,Ethereum Classic, (ETC).,[6],[7],
,The value of the Ethereum currency grew over 13,000 percent in 2017, to over $1400.,[8], By September 2018, it had fallen back to $200.,[9],

,Etymology,
,Vitalik Buterin picked the name Ethereum after browsing Wikipedia articles about elements and science fiction, when he found the name, noting, ""I immediately realized that I liked it better than all of the other alternatives that I had seen; I suppose it was the fact that sounded nice and it had the word ',ether,', referring to the hypothetical invisible medium that permeates the universe and allows light to travel.""
,
,History,
,Ethereum was initially described in a white paper by ,Vitalik Buterin,,,[10], a programmer involved with ,Bitcoin Magazine,, in late 2013 with a goal of building decentralized applications.,[11],[12], Buterin had argued that Bitcoin needed a ,scripting language, for application development. Failing to gain agreement, he proposed development of a new platform with a more general scripting language.,[13],:,88,
,At the time of public announcement in January 2014, the core Ethereum team was Vitalik Buterin, Mihai Alisie, Anthony Di Iorio, and Charles Hoskinson. Formal development of the Ethereum software project began in early 2014 through a ,Swiss, company, ,Ethereum Switzerland GmbH, (,EthSuisse,).,[14],[15], Subsequently, a Swiss non-profit foundation, the Ethereum Foundation (,Stiftung Ethereum,), was created as well. Development was funded by an online public ,crowdsale, during July–August 2014, with the participants buying the Ethereum value token (ether) with another digital currency, ,bitcoin,.
,While there was early praise for the technical innovations of Ethereum, questions were also raised about its security and scalability.,[11],
,
,Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA),
,In March 2017, various blockchain start-ups, research groups, and Fortune 500 companies announced the creation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) with 30 founding members.,[16], By May, the nonprofit organization had 116 enterprise members—including ,ConsenSys,, ,CME Group,, ,Cornell University's research group,, ,Toyota Research Institute,, ,Samsung SDS,, ,Microsoft,, ,Intel,, ,J. P. Morgan,, ,Cooley LLP,, ,Merck KGaA,, ,DTCC,, ,Deloitte,, ,Accenture,, ,Banco Santander,, ,BNY Mellon,, ,ING,, and ,National Bank of Canada,.,[17],[18],[19], By July 2017, there were over 150 members in the alliance, including recent additions ,MasterCard,, ,Cisco Systems,, ,Sberbank, and ,Scotiabank,.,[20],[21],

,Several codenamed prototypes of the Ethereum platform were developed by the Foundation, as part of their Proof-of-Concept series, prior to the official launch of the Frontier network. ""Olympic"" was the last of these prototypes, and public beta pre-release.
,The Olympic network provided users with a ,bug bounty, of 25,000 ether for stress testing the limits of the Ethereum blockchain. ""Frontier"" marked the tentative experimental release of the Ethereum platform in July 2015.,[22],
,Since the initial launch, Ethereum has undergone several planned protocol upgrades, which are important changes affecting the underlying functionality and/or ,incentive structures, of the platform.
,[23],[24],
,
,Protocol upgrades are accomplished by means of a ,soft fork, of the open source code base.
,
,""Homestead"" was the first to be considered ,stable,.
,It included improvements to transaction processing, gas pricing, and security
and the soft fork occurred on 31 July 2015.,[13],:,87,
,The ""Metropolis Part 1: Byzantium"" soft fork took effect on 16 October 2017, and included changes to reduce the complexity of the EVM and provide more flexibility for smart contract developers.,[24], Byzantium also adds supports for zk-SNARKs (from ,Zcash,); with the first zk-SNARK transaction occurring on testnet on September 19, 2017.
,
,The DAO event,
,Main article: ,The DAO (organization),
,In 2016 a ,decentralized autonomous organization, called ,The DAO,, a set of ,smart contracts, developed on the platform, raised a record ,US$150 million, in a ,crowdsale, to fund the project.,[25], The DAO was exploited in June when ,US$50 million, in Ether were taken by an unknown hacker.,[26],[27], The event sparked a debate in the crypto-community about whether Ethereum should perform a contentious ""hard fork"" to reappropriate the affected funds.,[28], As a result of the dispute, the network split in two. Ethereum (the subject of this article) continued on the forked blockchain, while ,Ethereum Classic, continued on the original blockchain. The hard fork created a rivalry between the two networks.
,After the hard fork related to The DAO, Ethereum subsequently forked twice in the fourth quarter of 2016 to deal with other attacks. By the end of November 2016, Ethereum had increased its ,DDoS, protection, de-bloated the blockchain, and thwarted further spam attacks by hackers.

,
,Ether, is a fundamental ,cryptocurrency, for operation of Ethereum, which thereby provides a public ,distributed ledger, for transactions. It is used to pay for gas, a unit of computation used in transactions and other state transitions. Mistakenly, this currency is also referred to as ,Ethereum,.
,It is listed under the code ETH and traded on ,cryptocurrency, exchanges, and the ,Greek, ,uppercase Xi, character (Ξ) is generally used for its ,currency symbol,. It is also used to pay for transaction fees and computational services on the Ethereum network.,[29],
,
,Characteristics,
,Further information: ,Cryptocurrency,
,As with other cryptocurrencies, the validity of each ether is provided by a ,blockchain,, which is a continuously growing list of ,records,, called ,blocks,, which are linked and secured using ,cryptography,.,[30],[31], By design, the blockchain is inherently resistant to modification of the data. It is an open, ,distributed ledger, that records transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way.,[32], Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum operates using accounts and balances in a manner called state transitions. This does not rely upon ,unspent transaction outputs, (UTXOs). State denotes the current balances of all accounts and extra data. State is not stored on the blockchain, it is stored in a separate ,Merkle, Patricia tree. A ,cryptocurrency wallet, stores the ,public and private ""keys"", or ""addresses"" which can be used to receive or spend Ether. These can be generated through BIP 39 style mnemonics for a BIP 32 ""HD Wallet"". In Ethereum, this is unnecessary as it does not operate in a UTXO scheme. With the private key, it is possible to write in the blockchain, effectively making an ether transaction.
,To send ether to an account, you need the public key of that account. Ether accounts are pseudonymous in that they are not linked to individual persons, but rather to one or more specific addresses.
,Owners can store these addresses in software, on paper and possibly in memory (""brain wallet"").
,
,Addresses,
,Ethereum addresses are composed of the prefix ""0x"", a common identifier for ,hexadecimal,, concatenated with the rightmost 20 bytes of the ,Keccak-256, hash (,big endian,) of the ,ECDSA, ,public key,. In hexadecimal, 2 digits represents a byte, meaning addresses contain 40 hexadecimal digits. One example is 0xb794F5eA0ba39494cE839613fffBA74279579268, the Poloniex ColdWallet. Contract addresses are in the same format, however they are determined by sender and creation transaction nonce.,[33], User accounts are indistinguishable from contract accounts given only an address for each and no blockchain data. Any valid Keccak-256 hash put into the described format is valid, even if it does not correspond to an account with a private key or a contract. This is unlike Bitcoin, which uses ,base58check, to ensure that addresses are properly typed.
,
,Comparison to bitcoin,
,Ether is different from ,Bitcoin, (the ,cryptocurrency, with the largest ,market capitalization, as of June 2018) in several aspects:
,
,Its ,block time, is 14 to 15 seconds, compared with 10 minutes for bitcoin.,
,Mining, of ether generates new coins at a usually consistent rate, occasionally changing during hard forks, while for bitcoin the rate halves every 4 years.,
,For proof-of-work, it uses the ,Ethash, algorithm which reduces the advantage of specialized ,ASICs, in mining.,
,Transaction fees differ by computational complexity, bandwidth use and storage needs (in a system known as gas), while bitcoin transactions compete by means of transaction size, in bytes.,
,Ethereum gas units each have a price that can be specified in a transaction. This is typically measured in Gwei. Bitcoin transactions usually have fees specified in satoshis per byte.,
,Transaction fees are generally considerably lower for ether than for Bitcoin. In December 2017, the median transaction fee for ether corresponded to $0.33, while for bitcoin it corresponded to $23.,
,Ethereum uses an account system where values in Wei are debited from accounts and credited to another, as opposed to Bitcoin's UTXO system, which is more analogous to spending cash and receiving change in return.,
,Supply,
,The total supply of ether was Ξ100 million as of June 2018. In 2017, mining generated 9.2 million new ether, corresponding to a 10% increase in its total supply. Casper FFG and CBC are expected to reduce the inflation rate to between 0.5% to 2%. There is no currently implemented hard cap on the total supply of ETH.
,
,Markets and stores,
,Ether can be traded by regular currency ,brokers,, ,cryptocurrency exchanges,, as well as many online ,cryptocurrency wallets,.,[34],
,
,Platform,
,Virtual Machine,
,The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum. It is a 256-bit register stack, designed to run the same code exactly as intended. It is the fundamental consensus mechanism for Ethereum. The formal definition of the EVM is specified in the Ethereum Yellow Paper.,[33],[35], On February 1, 2018, there were 27,500 nodes in the main Ethereum network.,[36], Ethereum Virtual Machines have been implemented in ,C++,, ,Go,, ,Haskell,, ,Java,, ,JavaScript,, ,Python,, ,Ruby,, ,Rust,, and ,WebAssembly, (currently under development).
,
,Smart contracts,
,Ethereum's ,smart contracts, are based on different computer languages, which developers use to program their own functionalities. Smart contracts are ,high-level, programming ,abstractions, that are compiled down to EVM ,bytecode, and deployed to the Ethereum blockchain for execution. They can be written in ,Solidity, (a language library with similarities to ,C, and ,JavaScript,), Serpent (similar to ,Python,, but deprecated), LLL (a ,low-level, ,Lisp,-like language), and Mutan (,Go,-based, but deprecated). There is also a research-oriented language under development called Viper (a ,strongly-typed, ,Python,-derived ,decidable language,).
,Smart contracts can be public, which opens up the possibility to prove functionality, e.g. self-contained ,provably fair, casinos.,[37],
,One issue related to using smart contracts on a public blockchain is that bugs, including security holes, are visible to all but cannot be fixed quickly.,[38], One example of this is the 17 June 2016 attack on The DAO, which could not be quickly stopped or reversed.,[26],
,There is ongoing research on how to use formal verification to express and prove non-trivial properties. A ,Microsoft Research, report noted that writing solid smart contracts can be extremely difficult in practice, using The DAO hack to illustrate this problem. The report discussed tools that Microsoft had developed for verifying contracts, and noted that a large-scale analysis of published contracts is likely to uncover widespread vulnerabilities. The report also stated that it is possible to verify the equivalence of a Solidity program and the EVM code.,[39],
,
,Applications,
,Ethereum is written in Turing complete language, which includes seven different programming languages.,[40], Developers use the language to create and publish applications which they know will run inside Ethereum.,[41],[42], It's a cumbersome system, but that's not deterring developers from writing Ethereum programs.,[43],
,Ethereum blockchain applications are usually referred to as DApps (,decentralized application,), since they are based on the decentralized Ethereum Virtual Machine, and its smart contracts.,[44], Many uses have been proposed for Ethereum platform, including ones that are impossible or unfeasible.,[45],[29], Use case proposals have included finance, the ,internet-of-things,, ,farm-to-table, produce, ,electricity sourcing and pricing,, and ,sports betting,. Ethereum is (as of 2017) the leading ,blockchain, platform for ,initial coin offering, projects, with over 50% market share.
,As of January 2018, there are more than 250 live DApps, with hundreds more under development. Some application examples include: digital signature algorithms, securitized tokens, digital rights management, crowdfunding, prediction markets, remittance, online gambling, social media platforms, financial exchanges and identity systems.
,
,Enterprise software,
,Ethereum-based customized software and networks, independent from the public Ethereum chain, are being tested by ,enterprise software, companies.,[46], Interested parties include ,Microsoft,, ,IBM,, ,JPMorgan Chase,,,[29],[47], ,Deloitte,,,[48], ,R3,,,[49], ,Innovate UK, (cross-border payments prototype).,[50], Barclays, UBS and Credit Suisse are experimenting with Ethereum blockchain to automate Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) II requirements.
,
,Permissioned ledgers,
,Ethereum-based ,permissioned blockchain, variants are used and being investigated for various projects.
,
,J. P. Morgan Chase, is developing a permissioned-variant of Ethereum blockchain dubbed ""Quorum"".,[51], It's designed to toe the line between private and public in the realm of shuffling derivatives and payments. The idea is to satisfy regulators who need seamless access to financial goings-on, while protecting the privacy of parties that don't wish to reveal their identities nor the details of their transactions to the general public.,[52],
,Royal Bank of Scotland, has announced that it has built a Clearing and Settlement Mechanism (CSM) based on the Ethereum distributed ledger and smart contract platform.,[53],[54],
,Performance,
,In Ethereum all smart contracts are stored publicly on every node of the blockchain, which has costs.,[55], Being a ,blockchain, means it is ,secure by design, and is an example of a distributed computing system with high ,Byzantine fault tolerance,. The downside is that performance issues arise in that every node is calculating all the smart contracts in real time, resulting in lower speeds.,[55], As of January 2016, the Ethereum protocol could process 25 transactions per second.,[55], In comparison, the ,Visa, payment platform processes 45,000 payments per second leading some to question the scalability of Ethereum.,[56], On 19 December 2016, Ethereum exceeded one million transactions in a single day for the first time.,[57],
,
,Micro Raiden was launched November 2017.,[58],
,Buterin and Joseph Poon (a co-author of ,Bitcoin,'s ,Lightning Network, whitepaper) announced in 2017 their plan to launch a scaling solution called Plasma which creates ""child"" blockchains to the ""main"" parent blockchain.,[59], The plasma project has skeptics; specifically, Vlad Zamfir (Ethereum's lead researcher on proof of stake) has publicly questioned the plasma project's viability.,[59],
,Ethereum engineers have been working on ,sharding, the calculations, and the next step (called Ethereum 2) was presented at Ethereum's Devcon 3 in November 2017.,[60],
,Ethereum's blockchain uses ,Merkle trees,, for security reasons, to improve scalability, and to optimize transaction hashing.,[61], As with any Merkle tree implementation, it allows for storage savings, set membership proofs (called ""Merkle proofs""), and light client synchronization. The Ethereum network has at times faced congestion problems, for example, congestion occurred during late 2017 in relation to ,Cryptokitties,.,[62],
,
,Development Governance and EIP,
,In October 2015,,[63], a development governance was proposed as ,Ethereum Improvement Proposal,, aka ,EIP,, standardized on EIP-1.,[64], The core development group and community were to gain consensus by a process regulated EIP. A few notable decisions were made in the process of EIP, such as EIP-160 (EXP cost increase caused by Spurious Dragon Hardfork),[65], and ,EIP-20 (ERC-20 Token Standard),.,[66], In January 2018, the EIP process was finalized and published as EIP-1 status turned ""active"".,[63],
,
,Criticisms,
,Izabella Kaminska, the editor of ,FT Alphaville,, has pointed out that criminals are using Ethereum to run ,Ponzi schemes, and other forms of investment fraud.,[67], The article was based on a paper from the ,University of Cagliari,, which placed the number of Ethereum smart contracts which facilitate Ponzi schemes at nearly 10% of 1384 smart contracts examined. However, it also estimated that only 0.05% of the transactions on the network were related to such contracts.,[68],

,Ruby on Rails,, or  ,Rails,, is a server-side ,web application framework, written in ,Ruby, under the ,MIT License,. Rails is a ,model–view–controller, (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a ,database,, a ,web service,, and ,web pages,. It encourages and facilitates the use of ,web standards, such as ,JSON, or ,XML, for data transfer, ,HTML,, ,CSS, and ,JavaScript, for user interfacing. In addition to MVC, Rails emphasizes the use of other well-known ,software engineering, ,patterns, and paradigms, including ,convention over configuration, (CoC), ,don't repeat yourself, (DRY), and the ,active record pattern,.,[4],
,Ruby on Rails' emergence in the 2000s greatly influenced web app development, through innovative features such as seamless database table creations, migrations, and ,scaffolding, of views to enable rapid application development.  Ruby on Rails' influence on other web frameworks remains apparent today, with many frameworks in other languages borrowing its ideas, including ,Django, in ,Python,, ,Catalyst, in ,Perl,, ,Laravel, in ,PHP,, ,Phoenix, in ,Elixir,, and ,Sails.js, in ,Node.js,.

,History,[,edit,],
,David Heinemeier Hansson, extracted Ruby on Rails from his work on the project management tool ,Basecamp, at the ,web application, company also called ,Basecamp,.,[5],
Hansson first released Rails as open source in July 2004, but did not share ,commit, rights to the project until February 2005.,[,citation needed,], In August 2006, the framework reached a milestone when ,Apple, announced that it would ship Ruby on Rails with ,Mac OS X v10.5 ""Leopard"",,,[6],
which was released in October 2007.
,Rails version 2.3 was released on March 15, 2009, with major new developments in templates, engines, ,Rack, and nested model forms. Templates enable the developer to generate a skeleton application with custom ,gems, and configurations. Engines give developers the ability to reuse application pieces complete with routes, view paths and models. The Rack web server interface and Metal allow one to write optimized pieces of code that route around Action Controller.,[7],
,On December 23, 2008, ,Merb,, another web application framework, was launched, and Ruby on Rails announced it would work with the Merb project to bring ""the best ideas of Merb"" into Rails 3, ending the ""unnecessary duplication"" across both communities.,[8], Merb was merged with Rails as part of the Rails 3.0 release.,[9],[10],
,Rails 3.1 was released on August 31, 2011, featuring Reversible Database Migrations, Asset Pipeline, Streaming, ,jQuery, as default ,JavaScript, library and newly introduced ,CoffeeScript, and ,Sass, into the stack.,[11],
,Rails 3.2 was released on January 20, 2012 with a faster development mode and routing engine (also known as Journey engine), Automatic Query Explain and Tagged Logging.,[12], Rails 3.2.x is the last version that supports Ruby 1.8.7.,[13], Rails 3.2.12 supports Ruby 2.0.,[14],
,Rails 4.0 was released on June 25, 2013, introducing Russian Doll Caching, Turbolinks, Live Streaming as well as making Active Resource, Active Record Observer and other components optional by splitting them as gems.,[15],
,Rails 4.1 was released on April 8, 2014, introducing Spring, Variants, Enums, Mailer previews, and secrets.yml.,[16],
,Rails 4.2 was released on December 19, 2014, introducing Active Job, asynchronous emails, Adequate Record, Web Console, and ,foreign keys,.,[17],
,Rails 5.0 was released on June 30, 2016, introducing Action Cable, API mode, and Turbolinks 5.,[18],
,Rails 5.0.0.1 was released on August 10, 2016, with Exclusive use of rails CLI over Rake and support for Ruby version 2.2.2 and above.
,Rails 5.1 was released on April 27, 2017, introducing ,JavaScript, integration changes (management of JavaScript dependencies from NPM via Yarn, optional compilation of JavaScript using ,Webpack,, and a rewrite of Rails UJS to use vanilla JavaScript instead of depending on jQuery), system tests using ,Capybara,, encrypted secrets, parameterized mailers, direct & resolved routes, and a unified form_with helper replacing the form_tag/form_for helpers.,[19],

,Technical overview,[,edit,],
,Like other web frameworks, Ruby on Rails uses the ,model–view–controller, (MVC) pattern to organize application programming.
,In a default configuration, a ,model, in the Ruby on Rails framework maps to a table in a database and to a Ruby file. For example, a model class ,User, will usually be defined in the file 'user.rb' in the app/models directory, and linked to the table 'users' in the database. While developers are free to ignore this convention and choose differing names for their models, files, and database table, this is not common practice and is usually discouraged in accordance with the ""convention-over-configuration"" philosophy.
,A ,controller, is a server-side component of Rails that responds to external requests from the web server to the application, by determining which view file to render. The controller may also have to query one or more models for information and pass these on to the view. For example, in an airline reservation system, a controller implementing a flight-search function would need to query a model representing individual flights to find flights matching the search, and might also need to query models representing airports and airlines to find related secondary data. The controller might then pass some subset of the flight data to the corresponding view, which would contain a mixture of static HTML and logic that use the flight data to create an HTML document containing a table with one row per flight. A controller may provide one or more actions. In Ruby on Rails, an action is typically a basic unit that describes how to respond to a specific external web-browser request. Also, note that the controller/action will be accessible for external web requests only if a corresponding route is mapped to it. Rails encourages developers to use ,RESTful, routes, which include actions such as create, new, edit, update, destroy, show, and index. These mappings of incoming requests/routes to controller actions can be easily set up in the routes.rb configuration file.
,A ,view, in the default configuration of Rails is an ,erb, file, which is evaluated and converted to ,HTML, at run-time. Alternatively, many other templating systems can be used for views.
,Ruby on Rails includes tools that make common development tasks easier ""out-of-the-box"", such as ,scaffolding, that can automatically construct some of the models and views needed for a basic ,website,.,[31], Also included are ,WEBrick,, a simple Ruby web server that is distributed with Ruby, and ,Rake,, a build system, distributed as a ,gem,. Together with Ruby on Rails, these tools provide a basic development environment.
,Ruby on Rails is most commonly not connected to the Internet directly, but through some front-end ,web server,. ,Mongrel, was generally preferred,[,by whom?,], over WEBrick in the early days,,[,citation needed,], but it can also run on ,Lighttpd,, ,Apache,, ,Cherokee,, ,Hiawatha,, ,Nginx, (either as a module – ,Phusion Passenger, for example – or via ,CGI,, ,FastCGI, or ,mod_ruby,), and many others. From 2008 onward, Passenger replaced Mongrel as the most-used web server for Ruby on Rails.,[32], Ruby is also supported natively on the ,IBM i,.,[33],
,Ruby on Rails is also noteworthy for its extensive use of the ,JavaScript, libraries, ,Prototype, and ,Script.aculo.us,, for scripting ,Ajax, actions.,[34], Ruby on Rails initially utilized lightweight ,SOAP, for web services; this was later replaced by RESTful ,web services,. Ruby on Rails 3.0 uses a technique called ,Unobtrusive JavaScript, to separate the functionality (or logic) from the structure of the web page. jQuery is fully supported as a replacement for Prototype and is the default JavaScript library in Rails 3.1, reflecting an industry-wide move towards jQuery. Additionally, ,CoffeeScript, was introduced in Rails 3.1 as the default JavaScript language.
,Since version 2.0, Ruby on Rails offers both HTML and XML as standard output formats. The latter is the facility for RESTful web services.
,Rails 3.1 introduced ,Sass, as standard ,CSS, templating.
,By default, the server uses ,Embedded Ruby, in the HTML views, with files having an html.erb extension.  Rails supports swapping-in alternative templating languages, such as ,HAML, and ,Mustache,.
,Ruby on Rails 3.0 has been designed to work with Ruby 1.8.7, Ruby 1.9.2, and ,JRuby, 1.5.2+; earlier versions are not supported.,[35],
,Ruby on Rails 3.2 is the last series of releases that support Ruby 1.8.7.
,
,Framework structure,[,edit,],
,Ruby on Rails is separated into various packages, namely ,ActiveRecord, (an ,object-relational mapping, system for database access), Active Resource (provides web services), Action Pack, Active Support and Action Mailer. Prior to version 2.0, Ruby on Rails also included the Action Web Service package that is now replaced by Active Resource. Apart from standard packages, developers can make ,plugins, to extend existing packages. Earlier Rails supported plugins within their own custom framework; version 3.2 deprecates these in favor of standard Ruby ""gems"".,[36],
,
,Deployment,[,edit,],
,Ruby on Rails is often installed using ,RubyGems,, a package manager,[37], which is included with current versions of Ruby. Many free ,Unix-like systems, also support installation of Ruby on Rails and its dependencies through their native ,package management system,.
,Ruby on Rails is typically deployed with a database server such as ,MySQL, or ,PostgreSQL,, and a web server such as ,Apache, running the ,Phusion Passenger, module.
,
,Philosophy and design,[,edit,],
,Ruby on Rails is intended to emphasize ,Convention over Configuration, (CoC), and the ,Don't Repeat Yourself, (DRY) principle.
,""Convention over Configuration"" means a developer only needs to specify unconventional aspects of the application. For example, if there is a class ,Sale, in the model, the corresponding table in the database is called ,sales, by default. It is only if one deviates from this convention, such as calling the table ""products sold"", that the developer needs to write code regarding these names. Generally, Ruby on Rails conventions lead to less code and less repetition.,[38],
,""Don't repeat yourself"" means that information is located in a single, unambiguous place. For example, using the ,ActiveRecord, module of Rails, the developer does not need to specify database column names in class definitions. Instead, Ruby on Rails can retrieve this information from the database based on the class name.
,""Fat models, skinny controllers"" means that most of the application logic should be placed within the model while leaving the controller as light as possible.
,
,Trademarks,[,edit,],
,In March 2007, ,David Heinemeier Hansson, filed three Ruby on Rails-related ,trademark, applications to the ,USPTO,. These applications regard the phrase ""RUBY ON RAILS"",,[39], the word ""RAILS"",,[40], and the official Rails logo.,[41], As a consequence, in the summer of 2007, Hansson denied permission to ,Apress, to use the Ruby on Rails logo on the cover of a new Ruby on Rails book written by some authoritative community members. The episode gave rise to a polite protest in the Ruby on Rails community.,[42],[43], In response to this criticism, Hansson replied:
,
,I only grant promotional use [of the Rails logo] for products I'm directly involved with. Such as books that I've been part of the development process for or conferences where I have a say in the execution. I would most definitely seek to enforce all the trademarks of Rails.,[42],
,Reception,[,edit,],
,Scalability,[,edit,],
,Rails running on ,Matz's Ruby Interpreter, (the ,de facto, reference interpreter for Ruby) had been criticized for issues with scalability.,[44], These critics often mentioned various ,Twitter, outages in 2007 and 2008, which spurred Twitter's partial transition to ,Scala, (which runs on the ,Java Virtual Machine,) for their ,queueing system, and other ,middleware,.,[45],[46], The user interface aspects of the site continued to run Ruby on Rails,[47], until 2011 when it was replaced due to concerns over performance,[48],
,In 2011, ,Gartner Research, noted that despite criticisms and comparisons to Java, many high-profile consumer web firms are using Ruby on Rails to build scalable web applications.  Some of the largest sites running Ruby on Rails include ,Airbnb,, ,GitHub,, ,Scribd,, ,Shopify,, ,Hulu,, and ,Basecamp,.,[49],  As of January 2016, it is estimated that more than 1.2 million web sites are running Ruby on Rails.,[50],[51],
,
,Security,[,edit,],
,In March 2012, security researcher Egor Homakov discovered a ""mass assignment"" vulnerability that allowed certain Rails applications to be remotely exploited, and demonstrated it by non-maliciously hacking ,GitHub, after his earlier attempts at responsible disclosure were dismissed.,[52],
,On September 24, 2013, a session cookie persistence security flaw was reported in Ruby on Rails. In a default configuration, the entire session hash is stored within a session cookie known as ,CookieStore,, allowing any authenticated session possessing the session cookie to log in as the target user at any time in the future. As a workaround, administrators are advised to configure cookies to be stored on the server using mechanisms such as ,ActiveRecordStore,.,[53],
,Researchers Daniel Jackson and Joseph Near developed a data debugger they called ""Space"" that can analyze the data access of a Rails program and determine if the program properly adheres to rules regarding access restrictions. On April 15, 2016, Near reported that an analysis of 50 popular Web applications using Space uncovered 23 previously unknown security flaws.,[54],

Elm is ,purely functional,, and is developed with emphasis on ,usability,, performance, and ,robustness,. It advertises ""no ,runtime, ,exceptions, in practice"",,[4], made possible by the Elm compiler's ,static type checking,.

,

,History,[,edit,],
,Elm was initially designed by Evan Czaplicki as his thesis in 2012.,[5], The first release of Elm came with many examples and an online editor that made it easy to try out in a ,web browser,.,[6], Evan Czaplicki joined ,Prezi, in 2013 to work on Elm,,[7], and in 2016 moved to ,NoRedInk, as an Open Source Engineer, also starting the Elm Software Foundation.,[8],
,The initial implementation of the Elm compiler targets ,HTML,, ,CSS,, and ,JavaScript,.,[9], The set of core tools has continued to expand, now including a ,REPL,,,[10], ,package manager,,,[11], time-traveling debugger,,[12], and installers for Mac and Windows.,[13], Elm also has an ecosystem of community created libraries,[14], and an advanced online editor that allows saved work and inclusion of community libraries.,[15],
,
,Features,[,edit,],
,Elm has a small but expressive set of language constructs, including traditional if-expressions, let-expressions for local state, and case-expressions for ,pattern matching,.,[16], As a functional language, it supports anonymous functions, functions as arguments, and partial application (,currying,) by default. Its semantics include immutable values, ,stateless functions,, and static typing with type inference. Elm programs render HTML through a virtual DOM, and may interoperate with other code by using ""JavaScript as a service"".
,
,Immutability,[,edit,],
,All values in Elm are ,immutable,, meaning that a value cannot be modified after it is created. Elm uses ,persistent data structures, to implement its ,Array,, ,Dict,, and ,Set, libraries.,[17],
,
,Static types,[,edit,],
,Elm is statically typed. Type annotations are optional (due to type inference) but strongly encouraged. Annotations exist on the line above the definition (unlike C-family languages where types and names are interspersed). Elm uses a single colon to mean ""has type"".
,Types include primitives like integers and strings, and basic data structures such as lists, tuples, and records. Functions have types written with arrows, for example ,round : Float -> Int,. ,Union types, allow the programmer to create custom types to represent data in a way that matches the problem domain.,[18],
,Types can refer to other types, for example a ,List Int,. Types are always capitalized; lowercase names are type variables. For example, a ,List a, is a list of values of unknown type. It is the type of the empty list and of the argument to ,List.length,, which is agnostic to the list's elements. There are a few special types that programmers create to interact with the Elm runtime. For example, ,Html Msg, represents a (virtual) DOM tree whose event handlers all produce messages of type ,Msg,.
,Rather than allow any value to be implicitly nullable (such a JavaScript's ,undefined, or a ,null pointer,), Elm's standard library defines a ,Maybe a, type. Code that produces or handles an optional value does so explicitly using this type, and all other code is guaranteed a value of the claimed type is actually present.
,
,Module system,[,edit,],
,Elm has a ,module system, that allows users to break their code into smaller parts called modules. Modules can hide implementation details such as helper functions, and group related code together. Modules serve as a namespace for imported code, such as ,Bitwise.and,. Third party libraries (or packages) consist of one or more modules, and are available from the ,Elm Public Library,. All libraries are versioned according to ,semver,, which is enforced by the compiler and other tools. That is, removing a function or changing its type can only be done in a major release.
,
,Interoperability with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,[,edit,],
,Elm uses an abstraction called ports to communicate with ,JavaScript,.,[19], It allows values to flow in and out of Elm programs, making it possible to communicate between Elm and JavaScript.
,Elm has a library called elm-html that a programmer can use to write HTML and CSS within Elm.,[20], It uses a virtual ,DOM, approach to make updates efficient.,[21],
,
,Limitations,[,edit,],
,Unlike ,Haskell, or PureScript, Elm has no support for ,higher-kinded types,, and thus cannot provide generic abstractions for many common operations.,[22], For example, there is no generic ,map,, ,apply,, ,fold,, or ,filter, function. Instead, such names are used prefixed by their module, such as ,List.map, and ,Dict.map,.

" 4 December 2018, at 21:18","Drupal,Drupal 8 in action. Showing in-context editing and previews (,WYSIWYG,).,Original author(s),Dries Buytaert,Developer(s),Drupal community,Initial release,May 18, 2000,; 18 years ago, (,2000-05-18,),[1],Stable release,8.6.4,[2],
   / 5 December 2018 ,[±],
,Repository,cgit,.drupalcode,.org,/drupal,
, ,Written in,PHP,, using ,Symfony,Operating system,Unix-like,, ,Windows,Platform,Cross-platform,Size,80 MB (uncompressed Drupal 8 core),[3],Available in,Multilingual,Type,Content management framework,, ,Content management system,, ,Community, and ,Blog software,License,GPLv2, or later,[4],Website,www,.drupal,.org,
,Drupal, ,/,ˈ,d,r,uː,p,əl,/, is ,[5], a ,free, and ,open source, ,content-management framework, written in ,PHP, and distributed under the ,GNU General Public License,.,[4],[6],[7], Drupal provides a ,back-end, framework for at least 2.3% of all ,web sites, worldwide,[8],[9], – ranging from personal ,blogs, to corporate, political, and government sites.,[10], Systems also use Drupal for ,knowledge management, and for business collaboration.,[11],
,As of  September 2018,[update],, the Drupal community comprised more than 1.3 million members,,[12],[13], including 112,500 users actively contributing,,[14], resulting in more than 41,500 free modules that extend and customize Drupal functionality,,[15], over 2,670 free themes that change the look and feel of Drupal,,[16], and at least 1,240 free distributions that allow users to quickly and easily set up a complex, use-specific Drupal in fewer steps.,[17],
,The standard release of Drupal, known as ,Drupal core,, contains basic features common to ,content-management systems,. These include user account registration and maintenance, menu management, ,RSS, feeds, taxonomy, page layout customization, and system administration. The Drupal core installation can serve as a simple Web site, a single- or multi-user blog, an ,Internet forum,, or a community Web site providing for ,user-generated content,.
,Drupal also describes itself as a ,Web application framework,.,[18], When compared with notable frameworks Drupal meets most of the generally accepted ,feature requirements, for such web frameworks.,[19],[20],[21],
,Although Drupal offers a sophisticated ,API, for developers, basic Web-site installation and administration of the framework require no programming skills.,[22],
,Drupal runs on any ,computing platform, that supports both a ,Web server, capable of running PHP and a ,database, to store content and configuration.

,
,  ,Drupal version 1-6 release history timeline,
,Originally written by ,Dries Buytaert, as a ,message board,, Drupal became an ,open source, project in 2001.,[26], The name ,Drupal, represents an English rendering of the ,Dutch, word ,druppel,, which means ""drop"" (as in a water droplet).,[27], The name came from the now-defunct Drop.org Web site, whose code slowly evolved into Drupal. Buytaert wanted to call the site ""dorp"" (Dutch for ""village"") for its community aspects, but mistyped it when checking the domain name and thought the error sounded better.,[26],
,Interest in Drupal got a significant boost in 2003 when it helped build ""DeanSpace"" for ,Howard Dean,, one of the candidates in the ,U.S. Democratic Party,'s primary campaign for the ,2004 U.S. presidential election,.  DeanSpace used open-source sharing of Drupal to support a decentralized network of approximately 50 disparate, unofficial pro-Dean websites that allowed users to communicate directly with one another as well as with the campaign.,[28], After Dean ended his campaign, members of his Web team continued to pursue their interest in developing a Web platform that could aid political activism by launching CivicSpace Labs in July 2004, ""...the first company with full-time employees that was developing and distributing Drupal technology."",[29], Other companies began to also specialize in Drupal development.,[30],[31], By 2013 the Drupal Web site listed hundreds of vendors that offered Drupal-related services.,[32],
,As of  2014,[update], Drupal is developed by a community,,[33], and its popularity is growing rapidly.,[,citation needed,], From July 2007 to June 2008 the Drupal.org site provided more than 1.4 million downloads of Drupal software, an increase of approximately 125% from the previous year.,[34],[35],
,As of  January 2017,[update], more than 1,180,000 sites use Drupal.,[36], These include hundreds of well-known organizations,,[37], including corporations, media and publishing companies, governments, non-profits,,[38], schools, and individuals.  Drupal has won several ,Packt, Open Source CMS Awards,[39], and won the ,Webware 100,[,clarification needed,], three times in a row.,[40],[41],
,Drupal 6 was released on February 13, 2008,[42],, on March 5, 2009 Buytaert announced a ,code freeze, for Drupal 7 for September 1, 2009.,[43], Drupal 7 was released on January 5, 2011, with release parties in several countries.,[44], After that, maintenance on Drupal 5 stopped, with only Drupal 7 and Drupal 6 maintained.,[45], Drupal 7 series maintenance updates are released regularly.,[46],
,On October 7, 2015 Drupal 8 first release candidate (rc1) was announced.,[47], Drupal 8 includes new features and improvements for both users and developers, including: a revamped user interface; WYSIWYG and in-place editing; improved mobile support; added and improved key contributed modules including Views, Date, and Entity Reference; introduced a new object-oriented backend leveraging Symfony components; revamped configuration management; and improved multilingual support. Drupal 8 rc1 is the collective work of over 3,200 core contributors.,[48],
,Drupal 8.0.0 was released on November 19, 2015.,[49], Subsequent major and minor releases (,8.6.3, as of November 7, 2018) which bring numerous improvements and bug fixes (including CKEditor WYSIWYG enhancements, added APIs, an improved help page) can be found on the ,Releases, page.,[50],
,
,Core,[,edit,],
,In the Drupal community, ""CORE"" refers to the collaboratively built codebase that can be extended through contributory modules and for versions prior to Drupal 8 is kept outside of the ""sites"" folder of a Drupal installation.,[51], (Starting with version 8, core is kept in its own 'core' sub-directory.) Drupal core is the stock element of Drupal. Bootstrap and Common libraries are defined as Drupal core and all other functionality is defined as Drupal modules including the system module itself.
,In a Drupal website's default configuration, authors can contribute content as either registered or anonymous users (at the discretion of the administrator). This content is accessible to web visitors through a variety of selectable criteria. As of Drupal 8, Drupal has adopted some ,Symfony, libraries into Drupal core.
,Core modules also includes a hierarchical ,taxonomy, system, which lets developers categorize content  or ,tagged, with key words for easier access.,[22],
,Drupal maintains a detailed ,changelog, of core feature updates by version.,[52],
,
,Core modules,[,edit,],
,Drupal core includes optional modules that can be enabled by the administrator to extend the functionality of the core website.,[53],
,The core Drupal distribution provides a number of features, including:,[53],
,
,
,Access statistics and logging,
,Advanced search,
,Blogs, books, comments, forums, and polls,
,Caching and feature throttling for improved performance,
,Descriptive URLs,
,Multi-level menu system,
,Multi-site support,[54],
,Multi-user content creation and editing,
,OpenID, support,
,RSS feed and feed aggregator,
,Security and new release update notification,
,User profiles,
,Various access control restrictions (user roles, IP addresses, email),
,Workflow tools (triggers and actions),
,Core themes,[,edit,],
,Drupal includes core themes, which customize the ""look and feel"" of Drupal sites,,[55], for example, Garland and Bartik.
,The Color Module, introduced in Drupal core 5.0, allows administrators to change the color scheme of certain themes via a browser interface.,[56],
,
,Localization,[,edit,],
,As of  January 2017,[update],, Drupal had been made available in 100 languages and ,English, (the default).,[57], Support is included for right-to-left languages such as ,Arabic,, ,Persian,, and ,Hebrew,.,[58],
,Drupal localization is built on top of ,gettext,, the GNU ,internationalization and localization, (i18n) library.
,
,Auto-update notification,[,edit,],
,Drupal can automatically notify the administrator about new versions of modules, themes, or the Drupal core.,[58], It's important to update quickly after security updates are released. 
,Before updating it is highly recommended to take backup of core, modules, theme, files and database. If there is any error shown after update or new updates is not compatible with a module, then it can be quickly replace by backup. There are several backup modules available in Drupal. 
,On October 15, 2014, a sql injection vulnerability was announced and update released.,[59], Two weeks later the Drupal security team released an advisory explaining that everyone should act under the assumption that any site not updated within 7 hours of the announcement are infected.,[60], Thus, it can be extremely important to apply these updates quickly and usage of a tool to make this process easier like ,drush, is highly recommended.
,
,Database abstraction,[,edit,],
,Prior to version 7, Drupal had functions that performed tasks related to databases, such as SQL query cleansing, multi-site table name prefixing, and generating proper SQL queries. In particular, Drupal 6 introduced an abstraction layer that allowed programmers to create SQL queries without writing SQL.
,Drupal 7 extends the data abstraction layer so that a programmer no longer needs to write SQL queries as text strings. It uses ,PHP Data Objects, to abstract the database. ,Microsoft, has written a database driver for their ,SQL Server,.,[61], Drupal 7 supports the file-based ,SQLite, database engine, which is part of the standard PHP distribution.
,
,Windows development,[,edit,],
,With Drupal 7's new database abstraction layer, and ability to run on the Windows web server ,IIS,, it is now easier for Windows developers to participate in the Drupal community. 
,A group on Drupal.org is dedicated to Windows issues.,[62],
,
,Accessibility,[,edit,],
,With the release of Drupal 7, ,Web accessibility, has been greatly improved by the Drupal community.,[63],  Drupal is a good framework for building sites accessible to people with disabilities, because many of the best practices have been incorporated into the program code Core. The accessibility team is carrying on the work of identifying and resolving accessibility barriers and raising awareness within the community. 
,Drupal 7 started the adoption of ,WAI-ARIA, support for ,Rich Internet Applications, and this has been carried further in Drupal 8. There have been many improvements to both the visitor and administrator sides of Drupal, especially:
,
,Drag and drop functionality,
,Improved color contrast and intensity,
,Adding skip navigation to core themes,
,Adding labels by default for input forms,
,Fixing CSS display:none with consistent methods for hiding and exposing text on focus.,
,The community also added an accessibility gate for core issues in Drupal 8.,[64],
,
,Extending the core,[,edit,],
,Drupal core is ,modular,, defining a system of ,hooks, and ,callbacks,, which are accessed internally via an ,API,.,[65], This design allows third-party contributed ,modules, and ,themes, to extend or override Drupal's default behaviors without changing Drupal core's code.
,Drupal isolates core files from contributed modules and themes. This increases flexibility and security and allows administrators to cleanly upgrade to new releases without overwriting their site's customizations.,[66], The Drupal community has the saying, ""Never hack core,"" a strong recommendation that site developers do not change core files.,[51],
,
,Modules,[,edit,],
,Contributed modules offer such additional or alternate features as image galleries, custom content types and content listings, ,WYSIWYG, editors, private messaging, third-party integration tools,,[67], integrating with BPM portals,,[68], and more. As of  January 2017,[update], the Drupal website lists more than 36,500 free ,modules,.,[15],
,Some of the most commonly used contributed modules include:,[69],
,
,Content Construction Kit (CCK): allows site administrators to dynamically create content types by extending the database schema. ""Content type"" describes the kind of information. Content types include, but are not limited to, events, invitations, reviews, articles, and products. The CCK Fields API is in Drupal core in Drupal 7.,[70],[71],
,Views: facilitates the retrieval and presentation, through a database abstraction system, of content to site visitors. Basic views functionality has been added to core in Drupal 8.,[72],
,Panels: drag and drop layout manager that allows site administrators to visually design their site.,
,Rules: conditionally executed actions based on recurring events.,
,Features: enables the capture and management of features (entities, views, fields, configuration, etc.) into custom modules.,
,Context: allows definition of sections of site where Drupal features can be conditionally activated,
,Media: makes photo uploading and media management easier,
,Services: provides an API for Drupal.,
,Organic Groups Mailing List,
,Themes,[,edit,],
,As of  January 2017,[update],, there are more than 2,400,[16], free community-contributed ,themes,. Themes adapt or replace a Drupal site's default look and feel.
,Drupal themes use standardized formats that may be generated by common third-party theme design engines. Many are written in the ,PHPTemplate, engine,[73], or, to a lesser extent, the ,XTemplate, engine.,[74], Some templates use hard-coded ,PHP,. Drupal 8 will integrate the ,Twig, templating engine.
,The inclusion of the PHPTemplate and XTemplate engines in Drupal addressed user concerns about flexibility and complexity.,[75], The Drupal theming system utilizes a ,template engine, to further separate ,HTML,/,CSS, from PHP. A popular Drupal contributed module called 'Devel' provides GUI information to developers and themers about the page build.
,Community-contributed themes,[76], at the Drupal website are released under a free ,GPL, license,,[77], and the most installed Drupal themes are ,listed on this page,.,[78],
,
,Distributions,[,edit,],
,In the past, those wanting a fully customized installation of Drupal had to download a pre-tailored version separately from the official Drupal core. Today, however, a distribution defines a packaged version of Drupal that upon installation, provides a website or application built for a specific purpose.
,The distributions offer the benefit of a new Drupal site without having to manually seek out and install third-party contributed modules or adjust configuration settings.,[79], They are collections of modules, themes, and associated configuration settings that prepare Drupal for custom operation. For example, a distribution could configure Drupal as a ""brochure"" site rather than a news site or ,online store,.
,
,Architecture,[,edit,],
,Drupal is based on the ,Presentation Abstraction Control, architecture, or PAC. 
,The ,menu system, acts as the Controller. It accepts input via a single source (,HTTP GET, and ,POST,), routes requests to the appropriate helper functions, pulls data out of the Abstraction (nodes and, from Drupal 5 onwards, forms), and then pushes it through a filter to get a Presentation of it (the theme system). 
,It even has multiple, parallel PAC agents in the form of blocks that push data out to a common canvas (page.tpl.php).,[80],
,
,Community,[,edit,],
,Drupal.org has a large community of users and developers who provide active ,community, support by coming up with new updates to help improve the functionality of Drupal,,[81], As of  January 2017,[update], more than 105,400 users are actively contributing.,[14], The semiannual DrupalCon conference alternates between North America, Europe and Asia.,[82], Attendance at DrupalCon grew from 500 at ,Szeged, in August 2008, to over 3,700 people at Austin, Texas in June, 2014.
,Smaller events, known as ""Drupal Camps"" or DrupalCamp,,[83], occur throughout the year all over the world. The annual Florida DrupalCamp brings users together for ,Coding for a Cause, that benefits a local nonprofit organization, as does the annual GLADCamp (,Greater Los Angeles Drupal, Camp) event, ,Coders with a Cause,.
,The Drupal community also organizes professional and semi-professional gatherings called ,meetups, at a large number of venues around the world. In July, 2013, ,Droplabs,, a co-working space in Los Angeles, California, was recognized as the world's ""Top Drupal Location,[84],"" (with 62 recorded events) when compared with other event venues over a 12-month period.
,There are a number of active Drupal forums,,[85], mailing lists,[86], and discussion groups.,[87], Drupal also maintains several ,IRC, channels,[88], on the ,Freenode, network.
,There are over 30 national communities,[89], around drupal.org offering language-specific support.
,Notable Drupal users include ,NBC,, ,Taboola,, ,Patch,, and ,We the People,.,[90],
,
,Security,[,edit,],
,Drupal's policy is to announce the nature of each security vulnerability once the fix is released.,[91],[92],
,Administrators of Drupal sites are automatically notified of these new releases via the Update Status module (Drupal 6) or via the Update Manager (Drupal 7).,[93], 
,Drupal maintains a security announcement mailing list, a history of all security advisories,,[94], a security team home page,,[95], and an RSS feed,[96], with the most recent security advisories.
,In mid-October 2014,,[97], Drupal issued a ""highly critical"" security advisory regarding an ,SQL injection, bug in Drupal 7, also known as Drupalgeddon.,[98],[99],  
,Downloading and installing an upgrade to Drupal 7.32 fixes the vulnerability, but does not remove any ,backdoor, installed by hackers if the site has already been ,compromised,.,[100],  Attacks began soon after the vulnerability was announced. According to the Drupal security team, where a site was not patched within hours of the announcement, it should be considered compromised and taken offline by being replaced with a static HTML page while the administrator of its server must be told that other sites on the same server may also have been compromised. 
,To solve the problem, the site must be restored using backups from before October 15, be patched and manually updated, and anything merged from the site must be audited.,[101],
,In late March 2018, a patch for vulnerability ,CVE,-2018-7600, also dubbed ,Drupalgeddon2,, was released. The underlying bug allows remote attackers without special roles or permissions to take complete control of Drupal 6, 7, and 8 sites. Starting early April, large scale automated attacks against vulnerable sites were observed,,[102], and on April 20th, a high level of penetration of unpatched sites was reported.,[103],
,
,Criticism,[,edit,],
,This section needs to be ,updated,., Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.,  ,(December 2014),
,In an article,[104], about the adoption of Drupal by the Whitehouse.gov site, ,Slate, associate editor Chris Wilson,[105], lists some common criticisms of Drupal. Other criticisms have included:
,
,Usability:, Aspects of the Drupal 6 administration interface were confusing and intimidating to some, particularly for new administrators.,[106],[107],[108], According to Dries Buytaert, Drupal 7 addressed 90% of the problems identified by usability tests conducted at the Universities of Minnesota and Baltimore.,[109],[110], To achieve this, ,Acquia, (the company founded by the project lead of Drupal) hired ,user experience, designer Mark Boulton to work with the Drupal community to design an improved user interface for Drupal's administration interface.,[111], The majority of his team's design work has been implemented by the community in Drupal 7. The 2011 usability test results from the University of Minnesota Office of Information Technology show that all of the major usability problems identified in Drupal 6 are either vastly improved or non-existent in Drupal 7. However, some new usability problems were identified.,[112],[113], Since the release of Drupal 7 there are now various distributions and applications to enhance the Back-end Usability of Drupal such as Drupal Gardens,,[114], Open Enterprise,[115], and Mitkom Builder.,[116],
,Learning curve:, Some users describe Drupal as being difficult to master.,[117],[118], Drupal's many contributed modules can have overlapping functionality and have been reported as overwhelming to new users.,[119],
,Backward compatibility (for software development):, Prior to 7, Drupal did not commit to backward compatibility across major revisions.,[120], This means that module and theme developers may have to rework their code to make it compatible. However, Drupal's policy is to not change how it uses data. This means that data from previous versions is still usable without alteration in the new release.,[121],[122], Drupal documents any incompatibilities, allowing the user to make informed decisions about when and whether to upgrade. Upgrades from 8 to 9 and beyond will require substantially less effort."" ,[123],
,Performance/scalability:, In 2008, ,performance, tests between Drupal 6.1 and ,Joomla, 1.5 demonstrated that Drupal's pages were delivered ""significantly faster"" than those of Joomla.,[124], Despite this, arguments over speed persist.,[125], Drupal is likely to be slower than a special-purpose application for a given task. For example, ,WordPress, typically outperforms Drupal as a single-user blogging tool. Drupal positions itself for broader applications requirements that are outside the scope of more narrowly focused applications.,[126], Drupal offers ,caching, to store various page elements, the use of which resulted in a 508% improvement in one benchmark.,[127], When using Drupal's default Page Cache mechanism, the cached pages are delivered only to anonymous users, so contributed modules must be installed to allow caching content for logged in users.,[128],[129], Like performance, ,scalability, (the ability to add servers to handle growing numbers of visitors with consistent response) can become a concern on large, interactive sites. ,MySQL,'s query caching can help reduce the load on the database server caused by Drupal's high ,query rate,.,[130],[131], Drupal caches database schema ,metadata, as well as elements such as blocks, forms and menus.,[132], Drupal 7 increases performance in database queries and reduces PHP code usage.,[133],
,Integrability with hosting structures:, Because of Drupal's demanding query requirements, Drupal-based websites can quickly become very taxing to hosts whose databases reside on a machine separate from their ,HTTP server,. While the issue can normally be addressed by implementing aggressive ,caching, as described above, such methods may be unimplementable in cases where the host does not offer access to ,PHP accelerators, like ,XCache, or ,APC,. Drupal has plugins that facilitate similar caching without requiring special PHP extensions.,[134],[135],
,The Drupal core search is ineffective at searching content:,[,citation needed,], There are contributed modules that will greatly improve the search functionality on a Drupal website, but they are not easily accessible due to a high learning curve and the difficulty users have in general of finding the right module.,[,citation needed,], One of the faceted search options is ,Apache Solr, Search Integration module, however, the module requires a dedicated server or ,virtual private server, (VPS) to operate because Solr must run on a ,servlet, container, e.g. ,Tomcat,, ,Jetty, or ,Resin,. These requirements make it harder for a Drupal website to have a functional search feature. In response some companies have created Apache Solr ,SaaS, products.,
,Many published, yet incomplete or outdated modules,[136], While Drupal's site boasts over 30,000 downloadable modules, searching the Drupal module directory finds many that are incomplete abandoned projects and do not work at all, only work for an outdated version due to lack of backward compatibility, or are unusable due to serious bugs.  This is due to the open source nature of Drupal, and the fact that anyone is free to start a module and publish it on drupal.org.  Modules with an active maintenance team are often highly polished, secure, and nearly bug free. Recent changes to the drupal.org website now let users search for modules, themes, and distributions, while filtering results by stability. ,[137],
,Difficult to unit test:,[138], Drupal 7 doesn't follow MVC framework and stores all of its configurations in database and as a result, unit testing the code without touching the database becomes extremely difficult. As a result, developers have resorted to using integration testing frameworks such as Red Test or behavior-driven development framework such as Behat and Codeception. Drupal 8 has taken a great stride in making it easier for developers to write unit-testable code.,
,There have also been criticism that Drupal is moving closer to the Enterprise Market and leaving smaller sites behind. The ,Backdrop CMS, project was forked by Nate Haug and Jen Lampton from Drupal about 2 years into the Drupal 8 development cycle. They claimed that Drupal was moving ""closer to the Enterprise market"" and that many in the community wouldn't be able (or willing) to make the jump. At that time the code was quite similar to that of Drupal 7—it was before the adoption of ,Symfony,, before the removal of much code that was not ,object-oriented,, and before widespread rewrites of many subsystems. ,[139],

If you find that your site is already patched but you didn’t do it, that can be a symptom that the site was compromised - some attacks have applied the patch as a way to guarantee they are the only attacker in control of the site.,

,Personal life,[,edit,],
,Buterin was born in ,Kolomna,, ,Moscow Oblast,, ,Russia,, to Dmitry Buterin, a computer scientist,,[4], and Natalia Ameline (née Chistyakova). He lived in the area until the age of six when his parents emigrated to ,Canada, in search of better employment opportunities.,[5], While in grade three of elementary school in Canada, Buterin was placed into a class for gifted children,[6], and started to understand that he was drawn to math, programming, and economics. He also had the ability to add three-digit numbers in his head at twice the speed of his peers.,[5],
,Buterin attended the ,Abelard School,, a private high school in Toronto, for four years,,[7], which he said, ""proved to be among the most interesting and productive years of my life; the closer connection between students and teachers [&] the level of depth at which the material was taught, made me want to learn, and to focus on learning as my primary goal"".,[7], Buterin has written that although he was ""never particularly inspired by the traditional education system"",,[7], when subjects were presented with ""dedication and focus on intellectual inquiry"", he said:
,
,""I noticed my attitude and my results almost immediately and drastically change. Education is ultimately much more than simply memorizing individual facts, or even learning individual concepts. [What] matters most: learning how to think, learning how to reason and learning how to learn."",[7],
,Buterin learned about Bitcoin, from his father, at age 17.,[5], In 2012, he obtained a bronze medal in the International Olympiad in Informatics.,[8], In 2013, he visited developers in other countries who shared his enthusiasm for code. He returned to Toronto later that year and published a ,white paper, proposing Ethereum.,[9], He attended the ,University of Waterloo, but dropped out in 2014, when he received the ,Thiel Fellowship, in the amount of $100,000,,[10], and went to work on Ethereum full-time.,[10],
,On June 25, 2017, Buterin was the subject of a ,death hoax, originating from ,4chan,.,[11],
,On 30 November 2018, Vitalik Buterin receives Honorary Doctorate from the Faculty of Business and Economics of the University of Basel on the occasion of the Dies Academicus. ,[12],
,
,Career,[,edit,],
,Beginnings at ,Bitcoin Magazine,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Bitcoin Magazine,
,Buterin met a person on a bitcoin chat forum trying to start a bitcoin blog. The owner offered five bitcoin (about $3.50) to anyone who would write an article for him. Buterin wrote for the site until its website shut down soon thereafter due to Bitcoin's lack of mainstream attention.,[13],
,In September 2011, another person reached out to Buterin about a new publication called ,Bitcoin Magazine,, a position which Buterin would accept as the first co-founder, and contribute as a leading writer.,[14],
,In addition Buterin wrote about bitcoin-related topics for other publications, including ,Bitcoin Weekly,.,[1],[15], ,Bitcoin Magazine, in 2012 later began publishing a print edition and has been referred to as the first serious publication dedicated to cryptocurrencies.,[16], ,Bitcoin Magazine, was then purchased by ,BTC Media,, where Buterin continued to write until mid-2014.,[,citation needed,],
,In addition, he held a position on the editorial board of ,Ledger,, a peer-reviewed scholarly journal that publishes full-length original research articles on the subjects of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.,[17],
,
,Ethereum,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Ethereum,
,Buterin is a co-founder and inventor of Ethereum, described as a ""decentralised mining network and software development platform rolled into one"",[18], that facilitates the creation of new cryptocurrencies and programs that share a single ,blockchain, (a cryptographic transaction ledger).,[19],[20],
,Buterin first described Ethereum in a white paper,[21], in late 2013. Buterin argued that bitcoin needed a scripting language for application development. But when he failed to gain agreement, he proposed development of a new platform with a more general scripting language.,[22],:,88, About the Ethereum Project, Buterin has said: ""I am truly grateful to have the opportunity to work in such an interesting and interdisciplinary area of industry, where I have the chance to interact with cryptographers, mathematicians and economists prominent in their fields, to help build software and tools that already affect tens of thousands of people around the world, and to work on advanced problems in computer science, economics and philosophy every week."",[7],
,
,Open source software,[,edit,],
,Buterin has contributed as a developer to other open source software projects.,[1], Some early examples are: Kryptokit, pybitcointools, multisig.info, and btckeysplit.,[23], He also contributed to DarkWallet,[24], by ,Cody Wilson,, ,Bitcoin, ,Python, libraries,,[25], and the ,cryptocurrency, marketplace site Egora.,[2],
,
,Ethereum Russia,[,edit,],
,As Buterin was recognizing the economic and political relevance of the Ethereum enterprise for his native Russia, he talked shortly with ,Vladimir Putin, on June 2nd 2017, at the ,St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, (SPIEF) event. The president of Russia stated that he ""supported the idea of establishing ties with possible Russian partners"".,[26],

,InterPlanetary File System, (,IPFS,) is a ,protocol, and network designed to create a ,content-addressable,, ,peer-to-peer, method of storing and sharing ,hypermedia, in a ,distributed file system,.,[2], IPFS was initially designed by ,Juan Benet,, and is now an ,open-source, project developed with help from the community.,[3],[4],

,History,[,edit,],
,In 2014, the IPFS protocol took advantage of the ,Bitcoin, ,blockchain, ,protocol, and network infrastructure in order to store unalterable data, remove duplicated files across the network, and obtain address information for accessing storage nodes to search for files in the network.,[5],[2],
,Implementations in ,Go,[6], and ,JavaScript,[7], exist, and a ,Python, implementation is in progress.,[8], The Go implementation is considered to be the ,reference implementation,[9], while formal ,specifications, are developed.,[10],
,
,Overview,[,edit,],
,IPFS is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. In some ways, IPFS is similar to the ,World Wide Web,, but IPFS could be seen as a single ,BitTorrent, swarm, exchanging objects within one ,Git, repository. In other words, IPFS provides a high-throughput, content-addressed ,block storage, model, with content-addressed ,hyperlinks,.,[11], This forms a generalized ,Merkle, ,directed acyclic graph, (DAG). IPFS combines a ,distributed hash table,, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace. IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other not to tamper with data in transit.,[12], Distributed Content Delivery saves bandwidth and prevents ,DDoS attacks,, which HTTP struggles with.,[5],
,The filesystem can be accessed in a variety of ways, including via ,FUSE, and over ,HTTP,.,[11],  A local file can be added to the IPFS filesystem, making it available to the world. Files are identified by their hashes, so it's caching-friendly. They are distributed using a BitTorrent-based protocol.  Other users viewing the content aid in serving the content to others on the network.  IPFS has a name service called IPNS, a global namespace based on ,PKI,, serves to build trust chains, is compatible with other NSes and can map ,DNS,, .onion, .bit, etc. to IPNS.,[13],
,
,  ,The Wikipedia logo has an IPFS hash with the following code: QmRW3V9znzFW9M5FYbitSEvd5dQrPWGvPvgQD6LM22Tv8D. It can be accessed with that hash over HTTP by a ,public gateway, or a ,local IPFS instance,
,Merkle data format,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Merkle tree,
,Every ,Merkle, is a ,directed acyclic graph, (DAG) because each node is accessed via its name. Each branch of Merkle is the hash of its local contents, naming children by their hash instead of their full contents. So after creation there is no way to edit a node. This prevents cycles (assuming there are no ,hash collisions,), since one cannot link the first created node to the last node to create the last reference.
,In general, for any Merkle to create a new branch or verify an existing branch, a hash algorithm is used on some combination of the local contents, such as a list of child hashes and other bytes. A few different hash algorithms are available in IPFS.
,The data input to any of those hash algorithms is documented.,[14],
,
,Notable users,[,edit,],
,The ,Catalan independence referendum,, taking place in September–October 2017, was deemed illegal by the ,Constitutional Court of Spain, and many related websites were blocked. Subsequently, the Catalan Pirate Party mirrored the website on IPFS to bypass the ,High Court of Justice of Catalonia, order of blocking.,[15],[16],
,IPFS was used to create a mirror of Wikipedia, which allows people living in jurisdictions where Wikipedia is blocked to access the content of Wikipedia.,[17],  That archived version of Wikipedia is a limited immutable copy that cannot be updated.  Efforts are being made to resolve mutable (updatable) and immutable (permanent archive) systems and interfaces.,[,citation needed,],
,Filecoin,, also inter-related to IPFS and developed by ,Juan Benet, and ,Protocol Labs,, is an IPFS-based ,cooperative storage cloud,.,[18],
,""In short: IPFS addresses and moves content; Filecoin is the missing incentive layer."",[19],

" 5 November 2018, at 20:21","  ,A timeline chart of how ,Linux distributions, have forked.,
,In ,software engineering,, a ,project fork, happens when developers take a copy of ,source code, from one ,software package, and start independent development on it, creating a distinct and separate piece of software. The term often implies not merely a ,development branch,, but also a split in the developer community, a form of ,schism,.,[1],
,Free and open-source software, is that which, by definition, may be forked from the original development team without prior permission, without violating ,copyright, law. However, licensed forks of proprietary software (,e.g., ,Unix,) also happen.

,Etymology,[,edit,],
,The word ""fork"" has been used to mean ""to divide in branches, go separate ways"" as early as the 14th century.,[2], In the software environment, the word evokes the ,fork, system call, which causes a running process to split itself into two (almost) identical copies that (typically) diverge to perform different tasks.,[3],
,In the context of software development, ""fork"" was used in the sense of creating a revision control "",branch,"" by ,Eric Allman, as early as 1980, in the context of ,SCCS,:,[4],

,
,The term was in use on ,Usenet, by 1983 for the process of creating a subgroup to move topics of discussion to.,[5],
,""Fork"" is not known to have been used in the sense of a community schism during the origins of Lucid Emacs (now ,XEmacs,) (1991) or the ,BSDs, (1993–1994); ,Russ Nelson, used the term ""shattering"" for this sort of fork in 1993, attributing it to ,John Gilmore,.,[6], However, ""fork"" was in use in the present sense by 1995 to describe the XEmacs split,,[7], and was an understood usage in the ,GNU, Project by 1996.,[8],
,
,Forking of free and open-source software,[,edit,],
,Free and open-source software may be legally forked without prior approval of those currently developing, managing, or distributing the software per both ,The Free Software Definition, and ,The Open Source Definition,:,[9],
,
,The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this, you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.,— ,The Free Software Definition,[10],
,
,3. Derived Works: The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.,— ,The Open Source Definition,[11],
,
,In free software, forks often result from a schism over different goals or personality clashes. In a fork, both parties assume nearly identical code bases, but typically only the larger group, or whoever controls the Web site, will retain the full original name and the associated user community. Thus, there is a reputation penalty associated with forking.,[9], The relationship between the different teams can be cordial or very bitter.
,Eric S. Raymond,, in his essay ,Homesteading the Noosphere,,,[12], stated that ""The most important characteristic of a fork is that it spawns competing projects that cannot later exchange code, splitting the potential developer community"". He notes in the ,Jargon File,:,[13],
,
,Forking is considered a Bad Thing—not merely because it implies a lot of wasted effort in the future, but because forks tend to be accompanied by a great deal of strife and acrimony between the successor groups over issues of legitimacy, succession, and design direction. There is serious social pressure against forking. As a result, major forks (such as the ,Gnu-Emacs,/,XEmacs, split, the fissioning of the ,386BSD, group into three daughter projects, and the short-lived GCC/EGCS split) are rare enough that they are remembered individually in hacker folklore.
,
,David A. Wheeler, notes,[9], four possible outcomes of a fork, with examples:
,
,The death of the fork. This is by far the most common case. It is easy to declare a fork, but considerable effort to continue independent development and support.,
,A re-merging of the fork (,e.g.,, ,egcs, becoming ""blessed"" as the new version of ,gcc,.),
,The death of the original (,e.g., the ,X.Org Server, succeeding and ,XFree86, dying.),
,Successful branching, typically with differentiation (,e.g.,, ,OpenBSD, and ,NetBSD,.),
,Distributed revision control, (DVCS) tools have popularised a less emotive use of the term ""fork"", blurring the distinction with ""branch"".,[14], With a DVCS such as ,Mercurial, or ,Git,, the normal way to contribute to a project, is to first create a personal branch of the repository, independent of the main repository, and later seek to have your changes integrated with it. Sites such as ,GitHub,, ,Bitbucket, and ,Launchpad, provide free DVCS hosting expressly supporting independent branches, such that the technical, social and financial barriers to forking a source code repository are massively reduced, and GitHub uses ""fork"" as its term for this method of contribution to a project.
,Forks often restart version numbering from 0.1 or 1.0 even if the original software was at version 3.0, 4.0, or 5.0. An exception is when the forked software is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the original project, ,e.g., ,MariaDB, for ,MySQL,[15], or ,LibreOffice, for ,OpenOffice.org,.
,
,Forking proprietary software,[,edit,],
,In ,proprietary software,, the copyright is usually held by the employing entity, not by the individual software developers. Proprietary code is thus more commonly forked when the owner needs to develop two or more versions, such as a ,windowed, version and a ,command line, version, or versions for differing operating systems, such as a ,word processor, for ,IBM PC, compatible machines and ,Macintosh, computers. Generally, such internal forks will concentrate on having the same look, feel, data format, and behavior between platforms so that a user familiar with one can also be productive or share documents generated on the other. This is almost always an economic decision to generate a greater ,market share, and thus pay back the associated extra development costs created by the fork.
,A notable proprietary fork not of this kind is the many varieties of proprietary ,Unix,—almost all derived from AT&T Unix under license and all called ""Unix"", but increasingly mutually incompatible.,[16], ,See, ,UNIX wars,.
,The ,BSD licenses, permit forks to become proprietary software, and some say,[,who?,], that commercial incentives thus make proprietisation almost inevitable. Examples include ,macOS, (based on the proprietary ,NeXTSTEP, and the open source ,FreeBSD,), ,Cedega, and ,CrossOver, (proprietary forks of ,Wine,, though CrossOver tracks Wine and contributes considerably), EnterpriseDB (a fork of ,PostgreSQL,, adding Oracle compatibility features,[17],), Supported PostgreSQL with their proprietary ESM storage system,,[18], and Netezza's,[19], proprietary highly scalable derivative of PostgreSQL. Some of these vendors contribute back changes to the community project, while some keep their changes as their own competitive advantages.

Hanken School of Economics. p. 57. ,Where practitioners have previously had rather narrow definitions of a fork, [...] the term now appears to be used much more broadly. Actions that would traditionally have been called a branch,  a new distribution, code fragmentation, a pseudo-fork, etc. may all now be called forks by some developers. This appears to be in no insignificant part due to the broad definition and use of the term fork by GitHub.,

,The ,hacker culture, is a ,subculture, of individuals who enjoy the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming limitations of ,software systems, to achieve novel and clever outcomes.,[1], The act of engaging in activities (such as programming or other media,[2],) in a spirit of playfulness and exploration is termed ""hacking"". However, the defining characteristic of a ,hacker, is not the activities performed themselves (e.g. ,programming,), but the manner in which it is done,[3], and whether it is something exciting and meaningful.,[2], Activities of playful cleverness can be said to have ""hack value"" and therefore the term ""hacks"" came about,,[3], with early examples including ,pranks at MIT, done by students to demonstrate their technical aptitude and cleverness. Therefore, the hacker culture originally emerged in academia in the 1960s around the ,Massachusetts Institute of Technology, (MIT)'s ,Tech Model Railroad Club, (TMRC),[4], and ,MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,.,[5], Hacking originally involved entering restricted areas in a clever way without causing any major damages. Some famous ,hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, were placing of a campus police cruiser on the roof of the Great Dome and converting the Great Dome into ,R2-D2,.,[6],
,Richard Stallman, explains about hackers who program:

They wanted to make their programs that they used be as good as they could. They also wanted to make them do neat things. They wanted to be able to do something in a more exciting way than anyone believed possible and show ""Look how wonderful this is. I bet you didn't believe this could be done."",[7],
,
,Hackers from this subculture tend to emphatically differentiate themselves from what they pejoratively call "",crackers,""; those who are generally referred to by media and members of the general public using the term ""hacker"", and whose primary focus‍—‌be it to malign or for malevolent purposes‍—‌lies in ,exploiting, weaknesses in computer security.,[8],

,Definition,
,The ,Jargon File,, an influential but not universally accepted compendium of hacker slang, defines hacker as ""A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and stretching their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary."",[9], The ,Request for Comments, (RFC) 1392, the Internet Users' Glossary, amplifies this meaning as ""A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular."",[10],
,As documented in the Jargon File, these hackers are disappointed by the mass media and general public's usage of the word ,hacker, to refer to ,security breakers,, calling them ""crackers"" instead. This includes both ""good"" crackers ("",white hat hackers,"") who use their computer security related skills and knowledge to learn more about how systems and networks work and to help to discover and fix security holes, as well as those more ""evil"" crackers ("",black hat hackers,"") who use the same skills to author harmful software (like viruses, trojans, etc.) and illegally infiltrate secure systems with the intention of doing harm to the system.,[11], The programmer subculture of hackers, in contrast to the cracker community, generally sees computer security related activities as contrary to the ideals of the original and true meaning of the hacker term that instead related to playful cleverness.,[11],
,
,History,
,The word ""hacker"" derives from the seventeenth-century word of a ""lusty laborer"" who harvested fields by dogged and rough swings of his hoe. Although the idea of ""hacking"" has existed long before the term ""hacker""‍—‌with the most notable example of ,Lightning Ellsworth,, it was not a word that the first programmers used to describe themselves. In fact, many of the first programmers were from engineering or physics backgrounds. 
,
,

,
,“
,
,""But from about 1945 onward (and especially during the creation of the first ENIAC computer) some programmers realized that their expertise in computer software and technology had evolved not just into a profession, but into a passion"" (46).,[1],
,
,”
,
,
,
,
,There was a growing awareness of a style of programming different from the cut and dried methods employed at first,,[12],[13], but it was not until the 1960s that the term hackers began to be used to describe proficient computer programmers. Therefore, the fundamental characteristic that links all who identify themselves as hackers are ones who enjoy ""…the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming and circumventing limitations of programming systems and who tries to extend their capabilities"" (47).,[1], With this definition in mind, it can be clear where the negative implications of the word ""hacker"" and the subculture of ""hackers"" came from.
,Some common nicknames among this culture include ""crackers"" who are unskilled thieves who mainly rely on luck. Others include ""phreak""‍—‌which refers to a type of skilled ,crackers, and ""warez d00dz""‍—‌which is a kind of cracker that acquires reproductions of copyrighted software. Within all hackers are tiers of hackers such as the ""samurai"" who are hackers that hire themselves out for legal electronic locksmith work. Furthermore, there are other hackers who are hired to test security, they are called ""sneakers"" or ""tiger teams"".
,Before communications between computers and computer users were as ,networked, as they are now, there were multiple independent and parallel hacker subcultures, often unaware or only partially aware of each other's existence. All of these had certain important traits in common:
,
,Creating software and sharing it with each other,
,Placing a high value on freedom of inquiry,
,Hostility to secrecy,
,Information-sharing as both an ideal and a practical strategy,
,Upholding the right to ,fork,
,Emphasis on rationality,
,Distaste for authority,
,Playful cleverness, taking the serious humorously and humor seriously,
,  ,The ,Glider,, proposed as an ,emblem of the ""hacker community"", by ,Eric S. Raymond,.,[14],
,These sorts of subcultures were commonly found at ,academic, settings such as ,college, ,campuses,. The ,MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,, the ,University of California, Berkeley, and ,Carnegie Mellon University, were particularly well-known hotbeds of early hacker culture. They evolved in parallel, and largely unconsciously, until the ,Internet,, where a legendary ,PDP-10, machine at MIT, called AI, that was running ,ITS,, provided an early meeting point of the hacker community. This and other developments such as the rise of the ,free software movement, and ,community, drew together a critically large population and encouraged the spread of a conscious, common, and systematic ethos. Symptomatic of this evolution were an increasing adoption of ,common slang, and a shared view of history, similar to the way in which other occupational groups have professionalized themselves but without the formal credentialing process characteristic of most professional groups.,[,citation needed,],
,Over time, the academic hacker subculture has tended to become more conscious, more cohesive, and better organized. The most important consciousness-raising moments have included the composition of the first ,Jargon File, in 1973, the promulgation of the ,GNU Manifesto, in 1985, and the publication of ,Eric Raymond,'s ,The Cathedral and the Bazaar, in 1997. Correlated with this has been the gradual recognition of a set of shared culture heroes, including: ,Bill Joy,, ,Donald Knuth,, ,Dennis Ritchie,, ,Alan Kay,, ,Ken Thompson,, ,Richard M. Stallman,, ,Linus Torvalds,, ,Larry Wall,, and ,Guido Van Rossum,.
,The concentration of academic hacker subculture has paralleled and partly been driven by the commoditization of computer and networking technology, and has, in turn, accelerated that process. In 1975, hackerdom was scattered across several different families of ,operating systems, and disparate networks; today it is largely a ,Unix, and ,TCP/IP, phenomenon, and is concentrated around various ,operating systems, based on ,free software, and ,open-source software, development.
,
,Ethics and principles,
,Main article: ,Hacker ethic,
,Many of the values and tenets of the free and open source software movement stem from the ,hacker ethics, that originated at ,MIT,[15], and at the ,Homebrew Computer Club,. The hacker ethics were chronicled by Steven Levy in ,Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution,[16], and in other texts in which Levy formulates and summarizes general hacker attitudes:
,
,Access to computers-and anything that might teach you something about the way the world works-should be unlimited and total.,
,All information should be free.,
,Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.,
,You can create art and beauty on a computer.,
,Computers can change your life for the better.,
,Hacker ethics are concerned primarily with sharing, openness, collaboration, and engaging in the hands-on imperative.,[16],
,Linus Torvalds,, one of the leaders of the open source movement (known primarily for developing the ,Linux kernel,), has noted in the book ,The Hacker Ethic,[17], that these principles have evolved from the known Protestant ethics and incorporates the spirits of capitalism, as introduced in the early 20th century by ,Max Weber,.
,Hack value is the notion used by hackers to express that something is worth doing or is interesting.,[18], This is something that hackers often feel intuitively about a problem or solution.
,An aspect of hack value is performing feats for the sake of showing that they can be done, even if others think it is difficult. Using things in a unique way outside their intended purpose is often perceived as having hack value. Examples are using a ,dot matrix impact printer, to produce musical notes, using a ,flatbed scanner, to take ultra-high-resolution photographs or using an ,optical mouse, as ,barcode reader,.
,A solution or feat has ""hack value"" if it is done in a way that has finesse, cleverness or brilliance, which makes ,creativity, an essential part of the meaning. For example, ,picking a difficult lock, has hack value; smashing it does not. As another example, proving ,Fermat's last theorem, by linking together most of modern mathematics has hack value; solving a combinatorial problem by ,exhaustively trying all possibilities, does not. Hacking is not using process of elimination to find a solution; it's the process of finding a clever solution to a problem.
,
,Uses,
,While using ,hacker, to refer to someone who enjoys playful cleverness is most often applied to computer programmers, it is sometimes used for people who apply the same attitude to other fields.,[8], For example, ,Richard Stallman, describes the silent composition ,4′33″, by John Cage and the 14th-century ,palindromic, three-part piece ""Ma Fin Est Mon Commencement"" by ,Guillaume de Machaut, as hacks.,[3], According to the Jargon File,,[9], the word ,hacker, was used in a similar sense among radio amateurs in the 1950s, predating the software hacking community.
,
,Programming,
,The Boston Globe, in 1984 defined ""hackers"" as ""computer nuts"".,[19], In their programmer subculture, a hacker is a person who follows a spirit of playful cleverness and loves programming. It is found in an originally academic movement unrelated to computer security and most visibly associated with ,free software,, ,open source, and ,demoscene,. It also has a ,hacker ethic,, based on the idea that writing software and sharing the result on a voluntary basis is a good idea, and that information should be free, but that it's not up to the hacker to make it free by breaking into private computer systems. This hacker ethic was publicized and perhaps originated in ,Steven Levy,'s ,Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution, (1984). It contains a codification of its principles.
,The programmer subculture of hackers disassociates from the mass media's pejorative use of the word 'hacker' referring to computer security, and usually prefer the term 'cracker' for that meaning. Complaints about supposed mainstream misuse started as early as 1983, when media used ""hacker"" to refer to the computer criminals involved in ,The 414s, case.,[20],
,In the programmer subculture of hackers, a computer hacker is a person who enjoys designing software and building programs with a sense for aesthetics and playful cleverness. The term hack in this sense can be traced back to ""describe the elaborate college pranks that...students would regularly devise"" (Levy, 1984 p. 10). To be considered a 'hack' was an honor among like-minded peers as ""to qualify as a hack, the feat must be imbued with innovation, style and technical virtuosity"" (Levy, 1984 p. 10) The ,MIT, ,Tech Model Railroad Club, Dictionary defined hack in 1959 (not yet in a computer context) as ""1) an article or project without constructive end; 2) a project undertaken on bad self-advice; 3) an entropy booster; 4) to produce, or attempt to produce, a hack(3)"", and ""hacker"" was defined as ""one who hacks, or makes them"". Much of TMRC's jargon was later imported into early computing culture, because the club started using a ,DEC, ,PDP-1, and applied its local model railroad slang in this computing context. Initially incomprehensible to outsiders, the slang also became popular in MIT's computing environments beyond the club. Other examples of jargon imported from the club are 'losing' (""when a piece of equipment is not working""),[16], and 'munged' (""when a piece of equipment is ruined"").,[16],
,Others did not always view hackers with approval. ,MIT living groups, in 1989 avoided advertising their sophisticated ,Project Athena, workstations to prospective members because they wanted residents who were interested in people, not computers, with one fraternity member stating that ""We were worried about the hacker subculture"".,[21],
,According to ,Eric S. Raymond,,,[22], the Open Source and Free Software hacker subculture developed in the 1960s among 'academic hackers',[23], working on early ,minicomputers, in ,computer science, environments in the United States.
,Hackers were influenced by and absorbed many ideas of key technological developments and the people associated with them. Most notable is the technical culture of the pioneers of the ,Arpanet,, starting in 1969. The ,PDP-10, AI machine at MIT, running the ,ITS, operating system and connected to the Arpanet, provided an early hacker meeting point. After 1980 the subculture coalesced with the culture of ,Unix,. Since the mid-1990s, it has been largely coincident with what is now called the ,free software, and ,open source movement,.
,Many programmers have been labeled ""great hackers"",,[24], but the specifics of who that label applies to is a matter of opinion. Certainly major contributors to ,computer science, such as ,Edsger Dijkstra, and ,Donald Knuth,, as well as the inventors of popular software such as ,Linus Torvalds, (,Linux,), and ,Ken Thompson, and ,Dennis Ritchie, (,Unix, and ,C programming language,) are likely to be included in any such list; see also ,List of programmers,. People primarily known for their contributions to the consciousness of the programmer subculture of hackers include ,Richard Stallman,, the founder of the free software movement and the ,GNU project,, president of the ,Free Software Foundation, and author of the famous ,Emacs, text editor as well as the ,GNU Compiler Collection (GCC),, and ,Eric S. Raymond,, one of the founders of the ,Open Source Initiative, and writer of the famous text ,The Cathedral and the Bazaar, and many other essays, maintainer of the ,Jargon File, (which was previously maintained by ,Guy L. Steele, Jr.,).
,Within the computer programmer subculture of hackers, the term hacker is also used for a programmer who reaches a goal by employing a series of modifications to extend existing ,code, or resources. In this sense, it can have a negative connotation of using inelegant ,kludges, to accomplish programming tasks that are quick, but ugly, inelegant, difficult to extend, hard to maintain and inefficient. This derogatory form of the noun "",hack,"" derives from the everyday English sense ""to cut or shape by or as if by crude or ruthless strokes"" [Merriam-Webster] and is even used among users of the positive sense of ""hacker"" who produces ""cool"" or ""neat"" hacks. In other words, to ""hack"" at an original creation, as if with an axe, is to force-fit it into being usable for a task not intended by the original creator, and a ""hacker"" would be someone who does this habitually. (The original creator and the hacker may be the same person.) This usage is common in both programming, engineering and building. In programming, hacking in this sense appears to be tolerated and seen as a necessary compromise in many situations. Some argue that it should not be, due to this negative meaning; others argue that some kludges can, for all their ugliness and imperfection, still have ""hack value"".
,In non-software engineering, the culture is less tolerant of unmaintainable solutions, even when intended to be temporary, and describing someone as a ""hacker"" might imply that they lack professionalism. In this sense, the term has no real positive connotations, except for the idea that the hacker is capable of doing modifications that allow a system to work in the short term, and so has some sort of marketable skills. However, there is always the understanding that a more skillful or technical logician could have produced successful modifications that would not be considered a ""hack-job"". The definition is similar to other, non-computer based uses of the term ""hack-job"". For instance, a professional modification of a production sports car into a racing machine would not be considered a hack-job, but a cobbled together backyard mechanic's result could be. Even though the outcome of a race of the two machines could not be assumed, a quick inspection would instantly reveal the difference in the level of professionalism of the designers. The adjective associated with hacker is ""hackish"" (see the ,Jargon file,).
,In a very universal sense, hacker also means someone who makes things work beyond perceived limits in a clever way in general, without necessarily referring to computers, especially at MIT.,[25], That is, people who apply the creative attitude of software hackers in fields other than computing. This includes even activities that predate computer hacking, for example ,reality hackers, or ,urban spelunkers, (exploring undocumented or unauthorized areas in buildings). One specific example is clever pranks,[26], traditionally perpetrated by MIT students, with the perpetrator being called hacker. For example, when MIT students surreptitiously put a fake police car atop the dome on MIT's Building 10,,[27], that was a hack in this sense, and the students involved were therefore hackers. Other types of hacking are ,reality hackers,, ,wetware, hackers (""hack your brain""), and ,media hackers, (""hack your reputation""). In a similar vein, a ""hack"" may refer to a ,math, hack, that is, a clever solution to a mathematical problem. All of these uses have spread beyond MIT.
,
,Home computing enthusiasts,
,Main article: ,Hacking of consumer electronics,
,In yet another context, a hacker is a computer hobbyist who pushes the limits of software or hardware. The home computer hacking subculture relates to the hobbyist home computing of the late 1970s, beginning with the availability of ,MITS Altair,. An influential organization was the ,Homebrew Computer Club,. However, its roots go back further to ,amateur radio, enthusiasts. The amateur radio slang referred to creatively tinkering to improve performance as ""hacking"" already in the 1950s.,[28],
,A large overlaps between hobbyist hackers and the programmer subculture hackers existed during the Homebrew Club's days, but the interests and values of both communities somewhat diverged. Today, the hobbyists focus on commercial ,computer and video games,, ,software cracking, and exceptional computer programming (,demo scene,). Also of interest to some members of this group is the modification of computer hardware and other electronic devices, see ,modding,.
,
,  ,A ,DIY, musician probes the circuit board of a synthesizer for ,""bends"", using a jeweler's screwdriver and alligator clips,
,Electronics hobbyists working on machines other than computers also fall into this category. This includes people who do simple modifications to ,graphing calculators,, ,video game consoles,, electronic ,musical keyboards, or other device (see ,CueCat, for a notorious example) to expose or add functionality to a device that was unintended for use by end users by the company who created it. A number of ,techno, musicians have modified 1980s-era ,Casio SK-1, sampling keyboards to create unusual sounds by doing ,circuit bending,: connecting wires to different leads of the integrated circuit chips. The results of these DIY experiments range from opening up previously inaccessible features that were part of the chip design to producing the strange, dis-harmonic digital tones that became part of the techno music style.
Companies take different attitudes towards such practices, ranging from open acceptance (such as ,Texas Instruments, for its graphing calculators and ,Lego, for its ,Lego Mindstorms, robotics gear) to outright hostility (such as ,Microsoft,'s attempts to lock out ,Xbox, hackers or the ,DRM, routines on ,Blu-ray Disc, players designed to sabotage compromised players.,[,citation needed,],)
,In this context, a ""hack"" refers to a ,program, that (sometimes illegally) modifies another program, often a video game, giving the user access to features otherwise inaccessible to them. As an example of this use, for ,Palm OS, users (until the 4th iteration of this ,operating system,), a ""hack"" refers to an extension of the operating system which provides additional functionality. Term also refers to those people who cheat on video games using special software. This can also refer to the ,jailbreaking, of ,iPhones,.
,
,Hacker artists,
,See also: ,Fractal art,, ,algorithmic art,, and ,interactive art,
,Hacker artists create ,art, by hacking on ,technology, as an ,artistic medium,. This has extended the definition of the term and what it means to be a hacker. Such ,artists, may work with ,graphics,, ,computer hardware,, ,sculpture,, ,music, and other ,audio,, ,animation,, ,video,, ,software,, ,simulations,, ,mathematics,, reactive ,sensory, systems, text, ,poetry,, ,literature,, or any combination thereof.
,Dartmouth College, musician Larry Polansky states:
,
,Technology and art are inextricably related. Many musicians, video artists, graphic artists, and even poets who work with technology—whether designing it or using it—consider themselves to be part of the 'hacker community.' Computer artists, like non-art hackers, often find themselves on society’s fringes, developing strange, innovative uses of existing technology. There is an empathetic relationship between those, for example, who design experimental music software and hackers who write communications ,freeware,.,[29],
,
,Another description is offered by Jenny Marketou: 
,
,Hacker artists operate as ,culture, hackers who manipulate existing techno-,semiotic, structures towards a different end, to get inside cultural systems on the net and make them do things they were never intended to do.,[30],
,
,A successful software and hardware hacker artist is ,Mark Lottor, (mkl), who has created the 3-D light art projects entitled the ,Cubatron,, and the ,Big Round Cubatron,. This art is made using custom computer technology, with specially designed ,circuit boards, and programming for ,microprocessor, chips to manipulate the ,LED, lights.
,
,Don Hopkins, is a software hacker artist well known for his artistic cellular automata. This art, created by a ,cellular automata, computer program, generates objects which randomly bump into each other and in turn create more objects and designs, similar to a lava lamp, except that the parts change color and form through interaction. Hopkins Says: ,Cellular automata are simple rules that are applied to a grid of cells, or the pixel values of an image. The same rule is applied to every cell, to determine its next state, based on the previous state of that cell and its neighboring cells. There are many interesting cellular automata rules, and they all look very different, with amazing animated dynamic effects. ',Life,' is a widely known cellular automata rule, but many other lesser known rules are much more interesting.
,
,Some hacker artists create art by writing computer code, and others, by developing hardware. Some create with existing software tools such as ,Adobe Photoshop, or ,GIMP,.
,The creative process of hacker artists can be more abstract than artists using non-technological media. For example, ,mathematicians, have produced visually stunning graphic presentations of ,fractals,, which hackers have further enhanced, often producing detailed and intricate graphics and animations from simple mathematical formulas.

,For the political term, see ,Benevolent dictatorship,.,
,Benevolent dictator for life, (,BDFL,) is a title given to a small number of ,open-source software development, leaders, typically project founders who retain the final say in disputes or arguments within the community. The phrase originated in 1995 with reference to ,Guido van Rossum,, creator of the ,Python programming language,,,[1],[2], while in 2018, Van Rossum stepped down as the leader in the language community after 30 years.
,Shortly after Van Rossum joined the ,Corporation for National Research Initiatives,, the term appeared in a follow-up mail by ,Ken Manheimer, to a meeting trying to create a semi-formal group that would oversee Python development and workshops; this initial use included the additional joke of naming Van Rossum the ""First Interim BDFL"".,[1], Van Rossum announced on July 12, 2018, that he would be stepping down from BDFL of Python.,[3],
,BDFL should not be confused with the more common term for open-source leaders, "",benevolent dictator,"", which was popularized by ,Eric S. Raymond,'s essay "",Homesteading the Noosphere,"" (1999).,[4], Among other topics related to ,hacker culture,, Raymond elaborates on how the nature of open source forces the ""dictatorship"" to keep itself benevolent, since a strong disagreement can lead to the ,forking, of the project under the rule of new leaders.

,InterPlanetary File System, (,IPFS,) is a ,protocol, and network designed to create a ,content-addressable,, ,peer-to-peer, method of storing and sharing ,hypermedia, in a ,distributed file system,.,[2], IPFS was initially designed by ,Juan Benet,, and is now an ,open-source, project developed with help from the community.,[3],[4],

,History,[,edit,],
,In 2014, the IPFS protocol took advantage of the ,Bitcoin, ,blockchain, ,protocol, and network infrastructure in order to store unalterable data, remove duplicated files across the network, and obtain address information for accessing storage nodes to search for files in the network.,[5],[2],
,Implementations in ,Go,[6], and ,JavaScript,[7], exist, and a ,Python, implementation is in progress.,[8], The Go implementation is considered to be the ,reference implementation,[9], while formal ,specifications, are developed.,[10],
,
,Overview,[,edit,],
,IPFS is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. In some ways, IPFS is similar to the ,World Wide Web,, but IPFS could be seen as a single ,BitTorrent, swarm, exchanging objects within one ,Git, repository. In other words, IPFS provides a high-throughput, content-addressed ,block storage, model, with content-addressed ,hyperlinks,.,[11], This forms a generalized ,Merkle, ,directed acyclic graph, (DAG). IPFS combines a ,distributed hash table,, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace. IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other not to tamper with data in transit.,[12], Distributed Content Delivery saves bandwidth and prevents ,DDoS attacks,, which HTTP struggles with.,[5],
,The filesystem can be accessed in a variety of ways, including via ,FUSE, and over ,HTTP,.,[11],  A local file can be added to the IPFS filesystem, making it available to the world. Files are identified by their hashes, so it's caching-friendly. They are distributed using a BitTorrent-based protocol.  Other users viewing the content aid in serving the content to others on the network.  IPFS has a name service called IPNS, a global namespace based on ,PKI,, serves to build trust chains, is compatible with other NSes and can map ,DNS,, .onion, .bit, etc. to IPNS.,[13],
,
,  ,The Wikipedia logo has an IPFS hash with the following code: QmRW3V9znzFW9M5FYbitSEvd5dQrPWGvPvgQD6LM22Tv8D. It can be accessed with that hash over HTTP by a ,public gateway, or a ,local IPFS instance,
,Merkle data format,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Merkle tree,
,Every ,Merkle, is a ,directed acyclic graph, (DAG) because each node is accessed via its name. Each branch of Merkle is the hash of its local contents, naming children by their hash instead of their full contents. So after creation there is no way to edit a node. This prevents cycles (assuming there are no ,hash collisions,), since one cannot link the first created node to the last node to create the last reference.
,In general, for any Merkle to create a new branch or verify an existing branch, a hash algorithm is used on some combination of the local contents, such as a list of child hashes and other bytes. A few different hash algorithms are available in IPFS.
,The data input to any of those hash algorithms is documented.,[14],
,
,Notable users,[,edit,],
,The ,Catalan independence referendum,, taking place in September–October 2017, was deemed illegal by the ,Constitutional Court of Spain, and many related websites were blocked. Subsequently, the Catalan Pirate Party mirrored the website on IPFS to bypass the ,High Court of Justice of Catalonia, order of blocking.,[15],[16],
,IPFS was used to create a mirror of Wikipedia, which allows people living in jurisdictions where Wikipedia is blocked to access the content of Wikipedia.,[17],  That archived version of Wikipedia is a limited immutable copy that cannot be updated.  Efforts are being made to resolve mutable (updatable) and immutable (permanent archive) systems and interfaces.,[,citation needed,],
,Filecoin,, also inter-related to IPFS and developed by ,Juan Benet, and ,Protocol Labs,, is an IPFS-based ,cooperative storage cloud,.,[18],

" 5 November 2018, at 20:21","  ,A timeline chart of how ,Linux distributions, have forked.,
,In ,software engineering,, a ,project fork, happens when developers take a copy of ,source code, from one ,software package, and start independent development on it, creating a distinct and separate piece of software. The term often implies not merely a ,development branch,, but also a split in the developer community, a form of ,schism,.,[1],
,Free and open-source software, is that which, by definition, may be forked from the original development team without prior permission, without violating ,copyright, law. However, licensed forks of proprietary software (,e.g., ,Unix,) also happen.

,Etymology,[,edit,],
,The word ""fork"" has been used to mean ""to divide in branches, go separate ways"" as early as the 14th century.,[2], In the software environment, the word evokes the ,fork, system call, which causes a running process to split itself into two (almost) identical copies that (typically) diverge to perform different tasks.,[3],
,In the context of software development, ""fork"" was used in the sense of creating a revision control "",branch,"" by ,Eric Allman, as early as 1980, in the context of ,SCCS,:,[4],

,
,The term was in use on ,Usenet, by 1983 for the process of creating a subgroup to move topics of discussion to.,[5],
,""Fork"" is not known to have been used in the sense of a community schism during the origins of Lucid Emacs (now ,XEmacs,) (1991) or the ,BSDs, (1993–1994); ,Russ Nelson, used the term ""shattering"" for this sort of fork in 1993, attributing it to ,John Gilmore,.,[6], However, ""fork"" was in use in the present sense by 1995 to describe the XEmacs split,,[7], and was an understood usage in the ,GNU, Project by 1996.,[8],
,
,Forking of free and open-source software,[,edit,],
,Free and open-source software may be legally forked without prior approval of those currently developing, managing, or distributing the software per both ,The Free Software Definition, and ,The Open Source Definition,:,[9],
,
,The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this, you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.,— ,The Free Software Definition,[10],
,
,3. Derived Works: The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.,— ,The Open Source Definition,[11],
,
,In free software, forks often result from a schism over different goals or personality clashes. In a fork, both parties assume nearly identical code bases, but typically only the larger group, or whoever controls the Web site, will retain the full original name and the associated user community. Thus, there is a reputation penalty associated with forking.,[9], The relationship between the different teams can be cordial or very bitter.
,Eric S. Raymond,, in his essay ,Homesteading the Noosphere,,,[12], stated that ""The most important characteristic of a fork is that it spawns competing projects that cannot later exchange code, splitting the potential developer community"". He notes in the ,Jargon File,:,[13],
,
,Forking is considered a Bad Thing—not merely because it implies a lot of wasted effort in the future, but because forks tend to be accompanied by a great deal of strife and acrimony between the successor groups over issues of legitimacy, succession, and design direction. There is serious social pressure against forking. As a result, major forks (such as the ,Gnu-Emacs,/,XEmacs, split, the fissioning of the ,386BSD, group into three daughter projects, and the short-lived GCC/EGCS split) are rare enough that they are remembered individually in hacker folklore.
,
,David A. Wheeler, notes,[9], four possible outcomes of a fork, with examples:
,
,The death of the fork. This is by far the most common case. It is easy to declare a fork, but considerable effort to continue independent development and support.,
,A re-merging of the fork (,e.g.,, ,egcs, becoming ""blessed"" as the new version of ,gcc,.),
,The death of the original (,e.g., the ,X.Org Server, succeeding and ,XFree86, dying.),
,Successful branching, typically with differentiation (,e.g.,, ,OpenBSD, and ,NetBSD,.),
,Distributed revision control, (DVCS) tools have popularised a less emotive use of the term ""fork"", blurring the distinction with ""branch"".,[14], With a DVCS such as ,Mercurial, or ,Git,, the normal way to contribute to a project, is to first create a personal branch of the repository, independent of the main repository, and later seek to have your changes integrated with it. Sites such as ,GitHub,, ,Bitbucket, and ,Launchpad, provide free DVCS hosting expressly supporting independent branches, such that the technical, social and financial barriers to forking a source code repository are massively reduced, and GitHub uses ""fork"" as its term for this method of contribution to a project.
,Forks often restart version numbering from 0.1 or 1.0 even if the original software was at version 3.0, 4.0, or 5.0. An exception is when the forked software is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the original project, ,e.g., ,MariaDB, for ,MySQL,[15], or ,LibreOffice, for ,OpenOffice.org,.
,
,Forking proprietary software,[,edit,],
,In ,proprietary software,, the copyright is usually held by the employing entity, not by the individual software developers. Proprietary code is thus more commonly forked when the owner needs to develop two or more versions, such as a ,windowed, version and a ,command line, version, or versions for differing operating systems, such as a ,word processor, for ,IBM PC, compatible machines and ,Macintosh, computers. Generally, such internal forks will concentrate on having the same look, feel, data format, and behavior between platforms so that a user familiar with one can also be productive or share documents generated on the other. This is almost always an economic decision to generate a greater ,market share, and thus pay back the associated extra development costs created by the fork.
,A notable proprietary fork not of this kind is the many varieties of proprietary ,Unix,—almost all derived from AT&T Unix under license and all called ""Unix"", but increasingly mutually incompatible.,[16], ,See, ,UNIX wars,.
,The ,BSD licenses, permit forks to become proprietary software, and some say,[,who?,], that commercial incentives thus make proprietisation almost inevitable. Examples include ,macOS, (based on the proprietary ,NeXTSTEP, and the open source ,FreeBSD,), ,Cedega, and ,CrossOver, (proprietary forks of ,Wine,, though CrossOver tracks Wine and contributes considerably), EnterpriseDB (a fork of ,PostgreSQL,, adding Oracle compatibility features,[17],), Supported PostgreSQL with their proprietary ESM storage system,,[18], and Netezza's,[19], proprietary highly scalable derivative of PostgreSQL. Some of these vendors contribute back changes to the community project, while some keep their changes as their own competitive advantages.

,Personal life,[,edit,],
,Buterin was born in ,Kolomna,, ,Moscow Oblast,, ,Russia,, to Dmitry Buterin, a computer scientist,,[4], and Natalia Ameline (née Chistyakova). He lived in the area until the age of six when his parents emigrated to ,Canada, in search of better employment opportunities.,[5], While in grade three of elementary school in Canada, Buterin was placed into a class for gifted children,[6], and started to understand that he was drawn to math, programming, and economics. He also had the ability to add three-digit numbers in his head at twice the speed of his peers.,[5],
,Buterin attended the ,Abelard School,, a private high school in Toronto, for four years,,[7], which he said, ""proved to be among the most interesting and productive years of my life; the closer connection between students and teachers [&] the level of depth at which the material was taught, made me want to learn, and to focus on learning as my primary goal"".,[7], Buterin has written that although he was ""never particularly inspired by the traditional education system"",,[7], when subjects were presented with ""dedication and focus on intellectual inquiry"", he said:
,
,""I noticed my attitude and my results almost immediately and drastically change. Education is ultimately much more than simply memorizing individual facts, or even learning individual concepts. [What] matters most: learning how to think, learning how to reason and learning how to learn."",[7],
,Buterin learned about Bitcoin, from his father, at age 17.,[5], In 2012, he obtained a bronze medal in the International Olympiad in Informatics.,[8], In 2013, he visited developers in other countries who shared his enthusiasm for code. He returned to Toronto later that year and published a ,white paper, proposing Ethereum.,[9], He attended the ,University of Waterloo, but dropped out in 2014, when he received the ,Thiel Fellowship, in the amount of $100,000,,[10], and went to work on Ethereum full-time.,[10],
,On June 25, 2017, Buterin was the subject of a ,death hoax, originating from ,4chan,.,[11],
,On 30 November 2018, Vitalik Buterin receives Honorary Doctorate from the Faculty of Business and Economics of the University of Basel on the occasion of the Dies Academicus. ,[12],
,
,Career,[,edit,],
,Beginnings at ,Bitcoin Magazine,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Bitcoin Magazine,
,Buterin met a person on a bitcoin chat forum trying to start a bitcoin blog. The owner offered five bitcoin (about $3.50) to anyone who would write an article for him. Buterin wrote for the site until its website shut down soon thereafter due to Bitcoin's lack of mainstream attention.,[13],
,In September 2011, another person reached out to Buterin about a new publication called ,Bitcoin Magazine,, a position which Buterin would accept as the first co-founder, and contribute as a leading writer.,[14],
,In addition Buterin wrote about bitcoin-related topics for other publications, including ,Bitcoin Weekly,.,[1],[15], ,Bitcoin Magazine, in 2012 later began publishing a print edition and has been referred to as the first serious publication dedicated to cryptocurrencies.,[16], ,Bitcoin Magazine, was then purchased by ,BTC Media,, where Buterin continued to write until mid-2014.,[,citation needed,],
,In addition, he held a position on the editorial board of ,Ledger,, a peer-reviewed scholarly journal that publishes full-length original research articles on the subjects of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.,[17],
,
,Ethereum,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Ethereum,
,Buterin is a co-founder and inventor of Ethereum, described as a ""decentralised mining network and software development platform rolled into one"",[18], that facilitates the creation of new cryptocurrencies and programs that share a single ,blockchain, (a cryptographic transaction ledger).,[19],[20],
,Buterin first described Ethereum in a white paper,[21], in late 2013. Buterin argued that bitcoin needed a scripting language for application development. But when he failed to gain agreement, he proposed development of a new platform with a more general scripting language.,[22],:,88, About the Ethereum Project, Buterin has said: ""I am truly grateful to have the opportunity to work in such an interesting and interdisciplinary area of industry, where I have the chance to interact with cryptographers, mathematicians and economists prominent in their fields, to help build software and tools that already affect tens of thousands of people around the world, and to work on advanced problems in computer science, economics and philosophy every week."",[7],
,
,Open source software,[,edit,],
,Buterin has contributed as a developer to other open source software projects.,[1], Some early examples are: Kryptokit, pybitcointools, multisig.info, and btckeysplit.,[23], He also contributed to DarkWallet,[24], by ,Cody Wilson,, ,Bitcoin, ,Python, libraries,,[25], and the ,cryptocurrency, marketplace site Egora.,[2],
,
,Ethereum Russia,[,edit,],
,As Buterin was recognizing the economic and political relevance of the Ethereum enterprise for his native Russia, he talked shortly with ,Vladimir Putin, on June 2nd 2017, at the ,St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, (SPIEF) event. The president of Russia stated that he ""supported the idea of establishing ties with possible Russian partners"".,[26],

,Drupal, ,/,ˈ,d,r,uː,p,əl,/, is ,[5], a ,free, and ,open source, ,content-management framework, written in ,PHP, and distributed under the ,GNU General Public License,.,[4],[6],[7], Drupal provides a ,back-end, framework for at least 2.3% of all ,web sites, worldwide,[8],[9], – ranging from personal ,blogs, to corporate, political, and government sites.,[10], Systems also use Drupal for ,knowledge management, and for business collaboration.,[11],
,As of  September 2018,[update],, the Drupal community comprised more than 1.3 million members,,[12],[13], including 112,500 users actively contributing,,[14], resulting in more than 41,500 free modules that extend and customize Drupal functionality,,[15], over 2,670 free themes that change the look and feel of Drupal,,[16], and at least 1,240 free distributions that allow users to quickly and easily set up a complex, use-specific Drupal in fewer steps.,[17],
,The standard release of Drupal, known as ,Drupal core,, contains basic features common to ,content-management systems,. These include user account registration and maintenance, menu management, ,RSS, feeds, taxonomy, page layout customization, and system administration. The Drupal core installation can serve as a simple Web site, a single- or multi-user blog, an ,Internet forum,, or a community Web site providing for ,user-generated content,.
,Drupal also describes itself as a ,Web application framework,.,[18], When compared with notable frameworks Drupal meets most of the generally accepted ,feature requirements, for such web frameworks.,[19],[20],[21],
,Although Drupal offers a sophisticated ,API, for developers, basic Web-site installation and administration of the framework require no programming skills.,[22],
,Drupal runs on any ,computing platform, that supports both a ,Web server, capable of running PHP and a ,database, to store content and configuration.

,  ,Drupal version 1-6 release history timeline,
,Originally written by ,Dries Buytaert, as a ,message board,, Drupal became an ,open source, project in 2001.,[26], The name ,Drupal, represents an English rendering of the ,Dutch, word ,druppel,, which means ""drop"" (as in a water droplet).,[27], The name came from the now-defunct Drop.org Web site, whose code slowly evolved into Drupal. Buytaert wanted to call the site ""dorp"" (Dutch for ""village"") for its community aspects, but mistyped it when checking the domain name and thought the error sounded better.,[26],
,Interest in Drupal got a significant boost in 2003 when it helped build ""DeanSpace"" for ,Howard Dean,, one of the candidates in the ,U.S. Democratic Party,'s primary campaign for the ,2004 U.S. presidential election,.  DeanSpace used open-source sharing of Drupal to support a decentralized network of approximately 50 disparate, unofficial pro-Dean websites that allowed users to communicate directly with one another as well as with the campaign.,[28], After Dean ended his campaign, members of his Web team continued to pursue their interest in developing a Web platform that could aid political activism by launching CivicSpace Labs in July 2004, ""...the first company with full-time employees that was developing and distributing Drupal technology."",[29], Other companies began to also specialize in Drupal development.,[30],[31], By 2013 the Drupal Web site listed hundreds of vendors that offered Drupal-related services.,[32],
,As of  2014,[update], Drupal is developed by a community,,[33], and its popularity is growing rapidly.,[,citation needed,], From July 2007 to June 2008 the Drupal.org site provided more than 1.4 million downloads of Drupal software, an increase of approximately 125% from the previous year.,[34],[35],
,As of  January 2017,[update], more than 1,180,000 sites use Drupal.,[36], These include hundreds of well-known organizations,,[37], including corporations, media and publishing companies, governments, non-profits,,[38], schools, and individuals.  Drupal has won several ,Packt, Open Source CMS Awards,[39], and won the ,Webware 100,[,clarification needed,], three times in a row.,[40],[41],
,Drupal 6 was released on February 13, 2008,[42],, on March 5, 2009 Buytaert announced a ,code freeze, for Drupal 7 for September 1, 2009.,[43], Drupal 7 was released on January 5, 2011, with release parties in several countries.,[44], After that, maintenance on Drupal 5 stopped, with only Drupal 7 and Drupal 6 maintained.,[45], Drupal 7 series maintenance updates are released regularly.,[46],
,On October 7, 2015 Drupal 8 first release candidate (rc1) was announced.,[47], Drupal 8 includes new features and improvements for both users and developers, including: a revamped user interface; WYSIWYG and in-place editing; improved mobile support; added and improved key contributed modules including Views, Date, and Entity Reference; introduced a new object-oriented backend leveraging Symfony components; revamped configuration management; and improved multilingual support. Drupal 8 rc1 is the collective work of over 3,200 core contributors.,[48],
,Drupal 8.0.0 was released on November 19, 2015.,[49], Subsequent major and minor releases (,8.6.3, as of November 7, 2018) which bring numerous improvements and bug fixes (including CKEditor WYSIWYG enhancements, added APIs, an improved help page) can be found on the ,Releases, page.,[50],
,
,Core,[,edit,],
,In the Drupal community, ""CORE"" refers to the collaboratively built codebase that can be extended through contributory modules and for versions prior to Drupal 8 is kept outside of the ""sites"" folder of a Drupal installation.,[51], (Starting with version 8, core is kept in its own 'core' sub-directory.) Drupal core is the stock element of Drupal. Bootstrap and Common libraries are defined as Drupal core and all other functionality is defined as Drupal modules including the system module itself.
,In a Drupal website's default configuration, authors can contribute content as either registered or anonymous users (at the discretion of the administrator). This content is accessible to web visitors through a variety of selectable criteria. As of Drupal 8, Drupal has adopted some ,Symfony, libraries into Drupal core.
,Core modules also includes a hierarchical ,taxonomy, system, which lets developers categorize content  or ,tagged, with key words for easier access.,[22],
,Drupal maintains a detailed ,changelog, of core feature updates by version.,[52],
,
,Core modules,[,edit,],
,Drupal core includes optional modules that can be enabled by the administrator to extend the functionality of the core website.,[53],
,The core Drupal distribution provides a number of features, including:,[53],
,
,
,Access statistics and logging,
,Advanced search,
,Blogs, books, comments, forums, and polls,
,Caching and feature throttling for improved performance,
,Descriptive URLs,
,Multi-level menu system,
,Multi-site support,[54],
,Multi-user content creation and editing,
,OpenID, support,
,RSS feed and feed aggregator,
,Security and new release update notification,
,User profiles,
,Various access control restrictions (user roles, IP addresses, email),
,Workflow tools (triggers and actions),
,Core themes,[,edit,],
,Drupal includes core themes, which customize the ""look and feel"" of Drupal sites,,[55], for example, Garland and Bartik.
,The Color Module, introduced in Drupal core 5.0, allows administrators to change the color scheme of certain themes via a browser interface.,[56],
,
,Localization,[,edit,],
,As of  January 2017,[update],, Drupal had been made available in 100 languages and ,English, (the default).,[57], Support is included for right-to-left languages such as ,Arabic,, ,Persian,, and ,Hebrew,.,[58],
,Drupal localization is built on top of ,gettext,, the GNU ,internationalization and localization, (i18n) library.
,
,Auto-update notification,[,edit,],
,Drupal can automatically notify the administrator about new versions of modules, themes, or the Drupal core.,[58], It's important to update quickly after security updates are released. 
,Before updating it is highly recommended to take backup of core, modules, theme, files and database. If there is any error shown after update or new updates is not compatible with a module, then it can be quickly replace by backup. There are several backup modules available in Drupal. 
,On October 15, 2014, a sql injection vulnerability was announced and update released.,[59], Two weeks later the Drupal security team released an advisory explaining that everyone should act under the assumption that any site not updated within 7 hours of the announcement are infected.,[60], Thus, it can be extremely important to apply these updates quickly and usage of a tool to make this process easier like ,drush, is highly recommended.
,
,Database abstraction,[,edit,],
,Prior to version 7, Drupal had functions that performed tasks related to databases, such as SQL query cleansing, multi-site table name prefixing, and generating proper SQL queries. In particular, Drupal 6 introduced an abstraction layer that allowed programmers to create SQL queries without writing SQL.
,Drupal 7 extends the data abstraction layer so that a programmer no longer needs to write SQL queries as text strings. It uses ,PHP Data Objects, to abstract the database. ,Microsoft, has written a database driver for their ,SQL Server,.,[61], Drupal 7 supports the file-based ,SQLite, database engine, which is part of the standard PHP distribution.
,
,Windows development,[,edit,],
,With Drupal 7's new database abstraction layer, and ability to run on the Windows web server ,IIS,, it is now easier for Windows developers to participate in the Drupal community. 
,A group on Drupal.org is dedicated to Windows issues.,[62],
,
,Accessibility,[,edit,],
,With the release of Drupal 7, ,Web accessibility, has been greatly improved by the Drupal community.,[63],  Drupal is a good framework for building sites accessible to people with disabilities, because many of the best practices have been incorporated into the program code Core. The accessibility team is carrying on the work of identifying and resolving accessibility barriers and raising awareness within the community. 
,Drupal 7 started the adoption of ,WAI-ARIA, support for ,Rich Internet Applications, and this has been carried further in Drupal 8. There have been many improvements to both the visitor and administrator sides of Drupal, especially:
,
,Drag and drop functionality,
,Improved color contrast and intensity,
,Adding skip navigation to core themes,
,Adding labels by default for input forms,
,Fixing CSS display:none with consistent methods for hiding and exposing text on focus.,
,The community also added an accessibility gate for core issues in Drupal 8.,[64],
,
,Extending the core,[,edit,],
,Drupal core is ,modular,, defining a system of ,hooks, and ,callbacks,, which are accessed internally via an ,API,.,[65], This design allows third-party contributed ,modules, and ,themes, to extend or override Drupal's default behaviors without changing Drupal core's code.
,Drupal isolates core files from contributed modules and themes. This increases flexibility and security and allows administrators to cleanly upgrade to new releases without overwriting their site's customizations.,[66], The Drupal community has the saying, ""Never hack core,"" a strong recommendation that site developers do not change core files.,[51],
,
,Modules,[,edit,],
,Contributed modules offer such additional or alternate features as image galleries, custom content types and content listings, ,WYSIWYG, editors, private messaging, third-party integration tools,,[67], integrating with BPM portals,,[68], and more. As of  January 2017,[update], the Drupal website lists more than 36,500 free ,modules,.,[15],
,Some of the most commonly used contributed modules include:,[69],
,
,Content Construction Kit (CCK): allows site administrators to dynamically create content types by extending the database schema. ""Content type"" describes the kind of information. Content types include, but are not limited to, events, invitations, reviews, articles, and products. The CCK Fields API is in Drupal core in Drupal 7.,[70],[71],
,Views: facilitates the retrieval and presentation, through a database abstraction system, of content to site visitors. Basic views functionality has been added to core in Drupal 8.,[72],
,Panels: drag and drop layout manager that allows site administrators to visually design their site.,
,Rules: conditionally executed actions based on recurring events.,
,Features: enables the capture and management of features (entities, views, fields, configuration, etc.) into custom modules.,
,Context: allows definition of sections of site where Drupal features can be conditionally activated,
,Media: makes photo uploading and media management easier,
,Services: provides an API for Drupal.,
,Organic Groups Mailing List,
,Themes,[,edit,],
,As of  January 2017,[update],, there are more than 2,400,[16], free community-contributed ,themes,. Themes adapt or replace a Drupal site's default look and feel.
,Drupal themes use standardized formats that may be generated by common third-party theme design engines. Many are written in the ,PHPTemplate, engine,[73], or, to a lesser extent, the ,XTemplate, engine.,[74], Some templates use hard-coded ,PHP,. Drupal 8 will integrate the ,Twig, templating engine.
,The inclusion of the PHPTemplate and XTemplate engines in Drupal addressed user concerns about flexibility and complexity.,[75], The Drupal theming system utilizes a ,template engine, to further separate ,HTML,/,CSS, from PHP. A popular Drupal contributed module called 'Devel' provides GUI information to developers and themers about the page build.
,Community-contributed themes,[76], at the Drupal website are released under a free ,GPL, license,,[77], and the most installed Drupal themes are ,listed on this page,.,[78],
,
,Distributions,[,edit,],
,In the past, those wanting a fully customized installation of Drupal had to download a pre-tailored version separately from the official Drupal core. Today, however, a distribution defines a packaged version of Drupal that upon installation, provides a website or application built for a specific purpose.
,The distributions offer the benefit of a new Drupal site without having to manually seek out and install third-party contributed modules or adjust configuration settings.,[79], They are collections of modules, themes, and associated configuration settings that prepare Drupal for custom operation. For example, a distribution could configure Drupal as a ""brochure"" site rather than a news site or ,online store,.
,
,Architecture,[,edit,],
,Drupal is based on the ,Presentation Abstraction Control, architecture, or PAC. 
,The ,menu system, acts as the Controller. It accepts input via a single source (,HTTP GET, and ,POST,), routes requests to the appropriate helper functions, pulls data out of the Abstraction (nodes and, from Drupal 5 onwards, forms), and then pushes it through a filter to get a Presentation of it (the theme system). 
,It even has multiple, parallel PAC agents in the form of blocks that push data out to a common canvas (page.tpl.php).,[80],
,
,Community,[,edit,],
,Drupal.org has a large community of users and developers who provide active ,community, support by coming up with new updates to help improve the functionality of Drupal,,[81], As of  January 2017,[update], more than 105,400 users are actively contributing.,[14], The semiannual DrupalCon conference alternates between North America, Europe and Asia.,[82], Attendance at DrupalCon grew from 500 at ,Szeged, in August 2008, to over 3,700 people at Austin, Texas in June, 2014.
,Smaller events, known as ""Drupal Camps"" or DrupalCamp,,[83], occur throughout the year all over the world. The annual Florida DrupalCamp brings users together for ,Coding for a Cause, that benefits a local nonprofit organization, as does the annual GLADCamp (,Greater Los Angeles Drupal, Camp) event, ,Coders with a Cause,.
,The Drupal community also organizes professional and semi-professional gatherings called ,meetups, at a large number of venues around the world. In July, 2013, ,Droplabs,, a co-working space in Los Angeles, California, was recognized as the world's ""Top Drupal Location,[84],"" (with 62 recorded events) when compared with other event venues over a 12-month period.
,There are a number of active Drupal forums,,[85], mailing lists,[86], and discussion groups.,[87], Drupal also maintains several ,IRC, channels,[88], on the ,Freenode, network.
,There are over 30 national communities,[89], around drupal.org offering language-specific support.
,Notable Drupal users include ,NBC,, ,Taboola,, ,Patch,, and ,We the People,.,[90],
,
,Security,[,edit,],
,Drupal's policy is to announce the nature of each security vulnerability once the fix is released.,[91],[92],
,Administrators of Drupal sites are automatically notified of these new releases via the Update Status module (Drupal 6) or via the Update Manager (Drupal 7).,[93], 
,Drupal maintains a security announcement mailing list, a history of all security advisories,,[94], a security team home page,,[95], and an RSS feed,[96], with the most recent security advisories.
,In mid-October 2014,,[97], Drupal issued a ""highly critical"" security advisory regarding an ,SQL injection, bug in Drupal 7, also known as Drupalgeddon.,[98],[99],  
,Downloading and installing an upgrade to Drupal 7.32 fixes the vulnerability, but does not remove any ,backdoor, installed by hackers if the site has already been ,compromised,.,[100],  Attacks began soon after the vulnerability was announced. According to the Drupal security team, where a site was not patched within hours of the announcement, it should be considered compromised and taken offline by being replaced with a static HTML page while the administrator of its server must be told that other sites on the same server may also have been compromised. 
,To solve the problem, the site must be restored using backups from before October 15, be patched and manually updated, and anything merged from the site must be audited.,[101],
,In late March 2018, a patch for vulnerability ,CVE,-2018-7600, also dubbed ,Drupalgeddon2,, was released. The underlying bug allows remote attackers without special roles or permissions to take complete control of Drupal 6, 7, and 8 sites. Starting early April, large scale automated attacks against vulnerable sites were observed,,[102], and on April 20th, a high level of penetration of unpatched sites was reported.,[103],
,
,Criticism,[,edit,],
,This section needs to be ,updated,., Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.,  ,(December 2014),
,In an article,[104], about the adoption of Drupal by the Whitehouse.gov site, ,Slate, associate editor Chris Wilson,[105], lists some common criticisms of Drupal. Other criticisms have included:
,
,Usability:, Aspects of the Drupal 6 administration interface were confusing and intimidating to some, particularly for new administrators.,[106],[107],[108], According to Dries Buytaert, Drupal 7 addressed 90% of the problems identified by usability tests conducted at the Universities of Minnesota and Baltimore.,[109],[110], To achieve this, ,Acquia, (the company founded by the project lead of Drupal) hired ,user experience, designer Mark Boulton to work with the Drupal community to design an improved user interface for Drupal's administration interface.,[111], The majority of his team's design work has been implemented by the community in Drupal 7. The 2011 usability test results from the University of Minnesota Office of Information Technology show that all of the major usability problems identified in Drupal 6 are either vastly improved or non-existent in Drupal 7. However, some new usability problems were identified.,[112],[113], Since the release of Drupal 7 there are now various distributions and applications to enhance the Back-end Usability of Drupal such as Drupal Gardens,,[114], Open Enterprise,[115], and Mitkom Builder.,[116],
,Learning curve:, Some users describe Drupal as being difficult to master.,[117],[118], Drupal's many contributed modules can have overlapping functionality and have been reported as overwhelming to new users.,[119],
,Backward compatibility (for software development):, Prior to 7, Drupal did not commit to backward compatibility across major revisions.,[120], This means that module and theme developers may have to rework their code to make it compatible. However, Drupal's policy is to not change how it uses data. This means that data from previous versions is still usable without alteration in the new release.,[121],[122], Drupal documents any incompatibilities, allowing the user to make informed decisions about when and whether to upgrade. Upgrades from 8 to 9 and beyond will require substantially less effort."" ,[123],
,Performance/scalability:, In 2008, ,performance, tests between Drupal 6.1 and ,Joomla, 1.5 demonstrated that Drupal's pages were delivered ""significantly faster"" than those of Joomla.,[124], Despite this, arguments over speed persist.,[125], Drupal is likely to be slower than a special-purpose application for a given task. For example, ,WordPress, typically outperforms Drupal as a single-user blogging tool. Drupal positions itself for broader applications requirements that are outside the scope of more narrowly focused applications.,[126], Drupal offers ,caching, to store various page elements, the use of which resulted in a 508% improvement in one benchmark.,[127], When using Drupal's default Page Cache mechanism, the cached pages are delivered only to anonymous users, so contributed modules must be installed to allow caching content for logged in users.,[128],[129], Like performance, ,scalability, (the ability to add servers to handle growing numbers of visitors with consistent response) can become a concern on large, interactive sites. ,MySQL,'s query caching can help reduce the load on the database server caused by Drupal's high ,query rate,.,[130],[131], Drupal caches database schema ,metadata, as well as elements such as blocks, forms and menus.,[132], Drupal 7 increases performance in database queries and reduces PHP code usage.,[133],
,Integrability with hosting structures:, Because of Drupal's demanding query requirements, Drupal-based websites can quickly become very taxing to hosts whose databases reside on a machine separate from their ,HTTP server,. While the issue can normally be addressed by implementing aggressive ,caching, as described above, such methods may be unimplementable in cases where the host does not offer access to ,PHP accelerators, like ,XCache, or ,APC,. Drupal has plugins that facilitate similar caching without requiring special PHP extensions.,[134],[135],
,The Drupal core search is ineffective at searching content:,[,citation needed,], There are contributed modules that will greatly improve the search functionality on a Drupal website, but they are not easily accessible due to a high learning curve and the difficulty users have in general of finding the right module.,[,citation needed,], One of the faceted search options is ,Apache Solr, Search Integration module, however, the module requires a dedicated server or ,virtual private server, (VPS) to operate because Solr must run on a ,servlet, container, e.g. ,Tomcat,, ,Jetty, or ,Resin,. These requirements make it harder for a Drupal website to have a functional search feature. In response some companies have created Apache Solr ,SaaS, products.,
,Many published, yet incomplete or outdated modules,[136], While Drupal's site boasts over 30,000 downloadable modules, searching the Drupal module directory finds many that are incomplete abandoned projects and do not work at all, only work for an outdated version due to lack of backward compatibility, or are unusable due to serious bugs.  This is due to the open source nature of Drupal, and the fact that anyone is free to start a module and publish it on drupal.org.  Modules with an active maintenance team are often highly polished, secure, and nearly bug free. Recent changes to the drupal.org website now let users search for modules, themes, and distributions, while filtering results by stability. ,[137],
,Difficult to unit test:,[138], Drupal 7 doesn't follow MVC framework and stores all of its configurations in database and as a result, unit testing the code without touching the database becomes extremely difficult. As a result, developers have resorted to using integration testing frameworks such as Red Test or behavior-driven development framework such as Behat and Codeception. Drupal 8 has taken a great stride in making it easier for developers to write unit-testable code.,
,There have also been criticism that Drupal is moving closer to the Enterprise Market and leaving smaller sites behind. The ,Backdrop CMS, project was forked by Nate Haug and Jen Lampton from Drupal about 2 years into the Drupal 8 development cycle. They claimed that Drupal was moving ""closer to the Enterprise market"" and that many in the community wouldn't be able (or willing) to make the jump. At that time the code was quite similar to that of Drupal 7—it was before the adoption of ,Symfony,, before the removal of much code that was not ,object-oriented,, and before widespread rewrites of many subsystems. ,[139],

,Ethereum, is an ,open-source,, ,public,, ,blockchain,-based ,distributed computing, platform and ,operating system, featuring ,smart contract, (scripting) functionality. It supports a modified version of ,Nakamoto, consensus via transaction-based state transitions.
,Ether, is a ,cryptocurrency, whose blockchain is generated by the Ethereum platform. ,Ether, can be transferred between accounts and used to compensate participant mining nodes for computations performed.,[3], Ethereum provides a decentralized ,virtual machine,, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which can execute scripts using an international network of public nodes. The virtual machine's ,instruction set,, in contrast to others like ,Bitcoin, ,Script,, is ,expressive, enough as languages like ,C, that it's said to be ,Turing-complete, in an informal sense. ""Gas"", an internal transaction pricing mechanism, is used to mitigate ,spam, and allocate resources on the network.
,Ethereum was proposed in late 2013 by ,Vitalik Buterin,, a cryptocurrency researcher and programmer. Development was funded by an online ,crowdsale, that took place between July and August 2014.
,The system went live on 30 July 2015, with 72 million coins ""premined"". 
This accounts for about 70 percent of the total circulating supply in 2018.
,In 2016, as a result of the exploitation of a flaw in ,The DAO, project's ,smart contract, software, and subsequent theft of $50 million worth of Ether,,[4], Ethereum was split into two separate blockchains – the new separate version became Ethereum (ETH) with the theft reversed,,[5], and the original continued as ,Ethereum Classic, (ETC).,[6],[7],
,The value of the Ethereum currency grew over 13,000 percent in 2017, to over $1400.,[8], By September 2018, it had fallen back to $200.,[9],

,Etymology,
,Vitalik Buterin picked the name Ethereum after browsing Wikipedia articles about elements and science fiction, when he found the name, noting, ""I immediately realized that I liked it better than all of the other alternatives that I had seen; I suppose it was the fact that sounded nice and it had the word ',ether,', referring to the hypothetical invisible medium that permeates the universe and allows light to travel.""
,
,History,
,Ethereum was initially described in a white paper by ,Vitalik Buterin,,,[10], a programmer involved with ,Bitcoin Magazine,, in late 2013 with a goal of building decentralized applications.,[11],[12], Buterin had argued that Bitcoin needed a ,scripting language, for application development. Failing to gain agreement, he proposed development of a new platform with a more general scripting language.,[13],:,88,
,At the time of public announcement in January 2014, the core Ethereum team was Vitalik Buterin, Mihai Alisie, Anthony Di Iorio, and Charles Hoskinson. Formal development of the Ethereum software project began in early 2014 through a ,Swiss, company, ,Ethereum Switzerland GmbH, (,EthSuisse,).,[14],[15], Subsequently, a Swiss non-profit foundation, the Ethereum Foundation (,Stiftung Ethereum,), was created as well. Development was funded by an online public ,crowdsale, during July–August 2014, with the participants buying the Ethereum value token (ether) with another digital currency, ,bitcoin,.
,While there was early praise for the technical innovations of Ethereum, questions were also raised about its security and scalability.,[11],
,
,Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA),
,In March 2017, various blockchain start-ups, research groups, and Fortune 500 companies announced the creation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) with 30 founding members.,[16], By May, the nonprofit organization had 116 enterprise members—including ,ConsenSys,, ,CME Group,, ,Cornell University's research group,, ,Toyota Research Institute,, ,Samsung SDS,, ,Microsoft,, ,Intel,, ,J. P. Morgan,, ,Cooley LLP,, ,Merck KGaA,, ,DTCC,, ,Deloitte,, ,Accenture,, ,Banco Santander,, ,BNY Mellon,, ,ING,, and ,National Bank of Canada,.,[17],[18],[19], By July 2017, there were over 150 members in the alliance, including recent additions ,MasterCard,, ,Cisco Systems,, ,Sberbank, and ,Scotiabank,.,[20],[21],

,Several codenamed prototypes of the Ethereum platform were developed by the Foundation, as part of their Proof-of-Concept series, prior to the official launch of the Frontier network. ""Olympic"" was the last of these prototypes, and public beta pre-release.
,The Olympic network provided users with a ,bug bounty, of 25,000 ether for stress testing the limits of the Ethereum blockchain. ""Frontier"" marked the tentative experimental release of the Ethereum platform in July 2015.,[22],
,Since the initial launch, Ethereum has undergone several planned protocol upgrades, which are important changes affecting the underlying functionality and/or ,incentive structures, of the platform.
,[23],[24],
,
,Protocol upgrades are accomplished by means of a ,soft fork, of the open source code base.
,
,""Homestead"" was the first to be considered ,stable,.
,It included improvements to transaction processing, gas pricing, and security
and the soft fork occurred on 31 July 2015.,[13],:,87,
,The ""Metropolis Part 1: Byzantium"" soft fork took effect on 16 October 2017, and included changes to reduce the complexity of the EVM and provide more flexibility for smart contract developers.,[24], Byzantium also adds supports for zk-SNARKs (from ,Zcash,); with the first zk-SNARK transaction occurring on testnet on September 19, 2017.

,In 2016 a ,decentralized autonomous organization, called ,The DAO,, a set of ,smart contracts, developed on the platform, raised a record ,US$150 million, in a ,crowdsale, to fund the project.,[25], The DAO was exploited in June when ,US$50 million, in Ether were taken by an unknown hacker.,[26],[27], The event sparked a debate in the crypto-community about whether Ethereum should perform a contentious ""hard fork"" to reappropriate the affected funds.,[28], As a result of the dispute, the network split in two. Ethereum (the subject of this article) continued on the forked blockchain, while ,Ethereum Classic, continued on the original blockchain. The hard fork created a rivalry between the two networks.
,After the hard fork related to The DAO, Ethereum subsequently forked twice in the fourth quarter of 2016 to deal with other attacks. By the end of November 2016, Ethereum had increased its ,DDoS, protection, de-bloated the blockchain, and thwarted further spam attacks by hackers.

,Ether, is a fundamental ,cryptocurrency, for operation of Ethereum, which thereby provides a public ,distributed ledger, for transactions. It is used to pay for gas, a unit of computation used in transactions and other state transitions. Mistakenly, this currency is also referred to as ,Ethereum,.
,It is listed under the code ETH and traded on ,cryptocurrency, exchanges, and the ,Greek, ,uppercase Xi, character (Ξ) is generally used for its ,currency symbol,. It is also used to pay for transaction fees and computational services on the Ethereum network.,[29],
,
,Characteristics,
,Further information: ,Cryptocurrency,
,As with other cryptocurrencies, the validity of each ether is provided by a ,blockchain,, which is a continuously growing list of ,records,, called ,blocks,, which are linked and secured using ,cryptography,.,[30],[31], By design, the blockchain is inherently resistant to modification of the data. It is an open, ,distributed ledger, that records transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way.,[32], Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum operates using accounts and balances in a manner called state transitions. This does not rely upon ,unspent transaction outputs, (UTXOs). State denotes the current balances of all accounts and extra data. State is not stored on the blockchain, it is stored in a separate ,Merkle, Patricia tree. A ,cryptocurrency wallet, stores the ,public and private ""keys"", or ""addresses"" which can be used to receive or spend Ether. These can be generated through BIP 39 style mnemonics for a BIP 32 ""HD Wallet"". In Ethereum, this is unnecessary as it does not operate in a UTXO scheme. With the private key, it is possible to write in the blockchain, effectively making an ether transaction.
,To send ether to an account, you need the public key of that account. Ether accounts are pseudonymous in that they are not linked to individual persons, but rather to one or more specific addresses.
,Owners can store these addresses in software, on paper and possibly in memory (""brain wallet"").
,
,Addresses,
,Ethereum addresses are composed of the prefix ""0x"", a common identifier for ,hexadecimal,, concatenated with the rightmost 20 bytes of the ,Keccak-256, hash (,big endian,) of the ,ECDSA, ,public key,. In hexadecimal, 2 digits represents a byte, meaning addresses contain 40 hexadecimal digits. One example is 0xb794F5eA0ba39494cE839613fffBA74279579268, the Poloniex ColdWallet. Contract addresses are in the same format, however they are determined by sender and creation transaction nonce.,[33], User accounts are indistinguishable from contract accounts given only an address for each and no blockchain data. Any valid Keccak-256 hash put into the described format is valid, even if it does not correspond to an account with a private key or a contract. This is unlike Bitcoin, which uses ,base58check, to ensure that addresses are properly typed.
,
,Comparison to bitcoin,
,Ether is different from ,Bitcoin, (the ,cryptocurrency, with the largest ,market capitalization, as of June 2018) in several aspects:
,
,Its ,block time, is 14 to 15 seconds, compared with 10 minutes for bitcoin.,
,Mining, of ether generates new coins at a usually consistent rate, occasionally changing during hard forks, while for bitcoin the rate halves every 4 years.,
,For proof-of-work, it uses the ,Ethash, algorithm which reduces the advantage of specialized ,ASICs, in mining.,
,Transaction fees differ by computational complexity, bandwidth use and storage needs (in a system known as gas), while bitcoin transactions compete by means of transaction size, in bytes.,
,Ethereum gas units each have a price that can be specified in a transaction. This is typically measured in Gwei. Bitcoin transactions usually have fees specified in satoshis per byte.,
,Transaction fees are generally considerably lower for ether than for Bitcoin. In December 2017, the median transaction fee for ether corresponded to $0.33, while for bitcoin it corresponded to $23.,
,Ethereum uses an account system where values in Wei are debited from accounts and credited to another, as opposed to Bitcoin's UTXO system, which is more analogous to spending cash and receiving change in return.,
,Supply,
,The total supply of ether was Ξ100 million as of June 2018. In 2017, mining generated 9.2 million new ether, corresponding to a 10% increase in its total supply. Casper FFG and CBC are expected to reduce the inflation rate to between 0.5% to 2%. There is no currently implemented hard cap on the total supply of ETH.
,
,Markets and stores,
,Ether can be traded by regular currency ,brokers,, ,cryptocurrency exchanges,, as well as many online ,cryptocurrency wallets,.,[34],
,
,Platform,
,Virtual Machine,
,The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum. It is a 256-bit register stack, designed to run the same code exactly as intended. It is the fundamental consensus mechanism for Ethereum. The formal definition of the EVM is specified in the Ethereum Yellow Paper.,[33],[35], On February 1, 2018, there were 27,500 nodes in the main Ethereum network.,[36], Ethereum Virtual Machines have been implemented in ,C++,, ,Go,, ,Haskell,, ,Java,, ,JavaScript,, ,Python,, ,Ruby,, ,Rust,, and ,WebAssembly, (currently under development).
,
,Smart contracts,
,Ethereum's ,smart contracts, are based on different computer languages, which developers use to program their own functionalities. Smart contracts are ,high-level, programming ,abstractions, that are compiled down to EVM ,bytecode, and deployed to the Ethereum blockchain for execution. They can be written in ,Solidity, (a language library with similarities to ,C, and ,JavaScript,), Serpent (similar to ,Python,, but deprecated), LLL (a ,low-level, ,Lisp,-like language), and Mutan (,Go,-based, but deprecated). There is also a research-oriented language under development called Viper (a ,strongly-typed, ,Python,-derived ,decidable language,).
,Smart contracts can be public, which opens up the possibility to prove functionality, e.g. self-contained ,provably fair, casinos.,[37],
,One issue related to using smart contracts on a public blockchain is that bugs, including security holes, are visible to all but cannot be fixed quickly.,[38], One example of this is the 17 June 2016 attack on The DAO, which could not be quickly stopped or reversed.,[26],
,There is ongoing research on how to use formal verification to express and prove non-trivial properties. A ,Microsoft Research, report noted that writing solid smart contracts can be extremely difficult in practice, using The DAO hack to illustrate this problem. The report discussed tools that Microsoft had developed for verifying contracts, and noted that a large-scale analysis of published contracts is likely to uncover widespread vulnerabilities. The report also stated that it is possible to verify the equivalence of a Solidity program and the EVM code.,[39],
,
,Applications,
,Ethereum is written in Turing complete language, which includes seven different programming languages.,[40], Developers use the language to create and publish applications which they know will run inside Ethereum.,[41],[42], It's a cumbersome system, but that's not deterring developers from writing Ethereum programs.,[43],
,Ethereum blockchain applications are usually referred to as DApps (,decentralized application,), since they are based on the decentralized Ethereum Virtual Machine, and its smart contracts.,[44], Many uses have been proposed for Ethereum platform, including ones that are impossible or unfeasible.,[45],[29], Use case proposals have included finance, the ,internet-of-things,, ,farm-to-table, produce, ,electricity sourcing and pricing,, and ,sports betting,. Ethereum is (as of 2017) the leading ,blockchain, platform for ,initial coin offering, projects, with over 50% market share.
,As of January 2018, there are more than 250 live DApps, with hundreds more under development. Some application examples include: digital signature algorithms, securitized tokens, digital rights management, crowdfunding, prediction markets, remittance, online gambling, social media platforms, financial exchanges and identity systems.
,
,Enterprise software,
,Ethereum-based customized software and networks, independent from the public Ethereum chain, are being tested by ,enterprise software, companies.,[46], Interested parties include ,Microsoft,, ,IBM,, ,JPMorgan Chase,,,[29],[47], ,Deloitte,,,[48], ,R3,,,[49], ,Innovate UK, (cross-border payments prototype).,[50], Barclays, UBS and Credit Suisse are experimenting with Ethereum blockchain to automate Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) II requirements.
,
,Permissioned ledgers,
,Ethereum-based ,permissioned blockchain, variants are used and being investigated for various projects.
,
,J. P. Morgan Chase, is developing a permissioned-variant of Ethereum blockchain dubbed ""Quorum"".,[51], It's designed to toe the line between private and public in the realm of shuffling derivatives and payments. The idea is to satisfy regulators who need seamless access to financial goings-on, while protecting the privacy of parties that don't wish to reveal their identities nor the details of their transactions to the general public.,[52],
,Royal Bank of Scotland, has announced that it has built a Clearing and Settlement Mechanism (CSM) based on the Ethereum distributed ledger and smart contract platform.,[53],[54],
,Performance,
,In Ethereum all smart contracts are stored publicly on every node of the blockchain, which has costs.,[55], Being a ,blockchain, means it is ,secure by design, and is an example of a distributed computing system with high ,Byzantine fault tolerance,. The downside is that performance issues arise in that every node is calculating all the smart contracts in real time, resulting in lower speeds.,[55], As of January 2016, the Ethereum protocol could process 25 transactions per second.,[55], In comparison, the ,Visa, payment platform processes 45,000 payments per second leading some to question the scalability of Ethereum.,[56], On 19 December 2016, Ethereum exceeded one million transactions in a single day for the first time.,[57],
,
,Micro Raiden was launched November 2017.,[58],
,Buterin and Joseph Poon (a co-author of ,Bitcoin,'s ,Lightning Network, whitepaper) announced in 2017 their plan to launch a scaling solution called Plasma which creates ""child"" blockchains to the ""main"" parent blockchain.,[59], The plasma project has skeptics; specifically, Vlad Zamfir (Ethereum's lead researcher on proof of stake) has publicly questioned the plasma project's viability.,[59],
,Ethereum engineers have been working on ,sharding, the calculations, and the next step (called Ethereum 2) was presented at Ethereum's Devcon 3 in November 2017.,[60],
,Ethereum's blockchain uses ,Merkle trees,, for security reasons, to improve scalability, and to optimize transaction hashing.,[61], As with any Merkle tree implementation, it allows for storage savings, set membership proofs (called ""Merkle proofs""), and light client synchronization. The Ethereum network has at times faced congestion problems, for example, congestion occurred during late 2017 in relation to ,Cryptokitties,.,[62],
,
,Development Governance and EIP,
,In October 2015,,[63], a development governance was proposed as ,Ethereum Improvement Proposal,, aka ,EIP,, standardized on EIP-1.,[64], The core development group and community were to gain consensus by a process regulated EIP. A few notable decisions were made in the process of EIP, such as EIP-160 (EXP cost increase caused by Spurious Dragon Hardfork),[65], and ,EIP-20 (ERC-20 Token Standard),.,[66], In January 2018, the EIP process was finalized and published as EIP-1 status turned ""active"".,[63],
,
,Criticisms,
,Izabella Kaminska, the editor of ,FT Alphaville,, has pointed out that criminals are using Ethereum to run ,Ponzi schemes, and other forms of investment fraud.,[67], The article was based on a paper from the ,University of Cagliari,, which placed the number of Ethereum smart contracts which facilitate Ponzi schemes at nearly 10% of 1384 smart contracts examined. However, it also estimated that only 0.05% of the transactions on the network were related to such contracts.,[68],

,Career,[,edit,],
,Buytaert defended his PhD dissertation in ,Computer Science, on 27 January 2008,[5], at ,Ghent University, in Belgium.,[6],
,From 1999-2000 he was the maintainer of the ,Linux,-,WLAN, FAQ,.,[7],
,On 1 December 2007, Dries,[8], announced, together with co-founder ,Jay Batson, the launch of a start-up called ,Acquia,.,[9], Acquia is a commercial open-source software company providing products, services, and technical support for Drupal. Acquia wants to be to Drupal what ,Red Hat, has been to ,Linux,.,[10], In 2009, Acquia helped re-launch Whitehouse.gov on Drupal.,[11],
,On 31 March 2008, Dries launched ,Mollom,, a service dedicated to stopping website spam: ""Mollom's purpose is to dramatically reduce the effort of keeping your site clean and the quality of your content high. Currently, Mollom is a spam-killing one-two punch combination of a state-of-the-art spam filter and CAPTCHA server."" Over 59,000 websites are protected by the Mollom service,,[12], including all of ,Netlog,'s messages.,[13],
,In 2008, Buytaert was elected ""Young Entrepreneurs of Tech"" by ,BusinessWeek,.,[14], He was also named to the ,MIT, ,Technology Review, ,TR35, as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.,[15],[16],
,
,Dismissal of Larry Garfield,[,edit,],
,In March of 2017, Buytaert fired veteran Drupal developer Larry Garfield and disinvited him from DrupalCon, shortly after forum posts came to light that outed Garfield as a participant in the ,Gorean subculture,. In a March 22 blog post, Garfield accused Buytaert of tolerating ,doxing, and wrote that Drupal's Community Working Group had not found any Code of Conduct violations in his history.,[17], Buytaert made a post the next day which defended the firing as necessary for fostering an inclusive community. He also wrote that his precise reasoning was confidential and that he ""did not make the decision based on the information or beliefs conveyed in Larry's blog post."",[17], Several commentators disputed this characterization citing Buytaert's criticism of Gorean gender roles in the same post and the deleted sentence ""further participation in a leadership role implies our community is complicit with and/or endorses these views, which we do not."",[18], Garfield also stated that he was ignorant of other ""things not mentioned"" that could have led to his dismissal.,[19], 85 Drupal developers posted an open letter criticizing Buytaert for his handling of the situation with ,Jon Evans, describing it as a form of ,victim blaming,.,[17],[20],

,The ,hacker culture, is a ,subculture, of individuals who enjoy the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming limitations of ,software systems, to achieve novel and clever outcomes.,[1], The act of engaging in activities (such as programming or other media,[2],) in a spirit of playfulness and exploration is termed ""hacking"". However, the defining characteristic of a ,hacker, is not the activities performed themselves (e.g. ,programming,), but the manner in which it is done,[3], and whether it is something exciting and meaningful.,[2], Activities of playful cleverness can be said to have ""hack value"" and therefore the term ""hacks"" came about,,[3], with early examples including ,pranks at MIT, done by students to demonstrate their technical aptitude and cleverness. Therefore, the hacker culture originally emerged in academia in the 1960s around the ,Massachusetts Institute of Technology, (MIT)'s ,Tech Model Railroad Club, (TMRC),[4], and ,MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,.,[5], Hacking originally involved entering restricted areas in a clever way without causing any major damages. Some famous ,hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, were placing of a campus police cruiser on the roof of the Great Dome and converting the Great Dome into ,R2-D2,.,[6],
,Richard Stallman, explains about hackers who program:

They wanted to make their programs that they used be as good as they could. They also wanted to make them do neat things. They wanted to be able to do something in a more exciting way than anyone believed possible and show ""Look how wonderful this is. I bet you didn't believe this could be done."",[7],
,
,Hackers from this subculture tend to emphatically differentiate themselves from what they pejoratively call "",crackers,""; those who are generally referred to by media and members of the general public using the term ""hacker"", and whose primary focus‍—‌be it to malign or for malevolent purposes‍—‌lies in ,exploiting, weaknesses in computer security.,[8],

,Definition,
,The ,Jargon File,, an influential but not universally accepted compendium of hacker slang, defines hacker as ""A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and stretching their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary."",[9], The ,Request for Comments, (RFC) 1392, the Internet Users' Glossary, amplifies this meaning as ""A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular."",[10],
,As documented in the Jargon File, these hackers are disappointed by the mass media and general public's usage of the word ,hacker, to refer to ,security breakers,, calling them ""crackers"" instead. This includes both ""good"" crackers ("",white hat hackers,"") who use their computer security related skills and knowledge to learn more about how systems and networks work and to help to discover and fix security holes, as well as those more ""evil"" crackers ("",black hat hackers,"") who use the same skills to author harmful software (like viruses, trojans, etc.) and illegally infiltrate secure systems with the intention of doing harm to the system.,[11], The programmer subculture of hackers, in contrast to the cracker community, generally sees computer security related activities as contrary to the ideals of the original and true meaning of the hacker term that instead related to playful cleverness.,[11],
,
,History,
,The word ""hacker"" derives from the seventeenth-century word of a ""lusty laborer"" who harvested fields by dogged and rough swings of his hoe. Although the idea of ""hacking"" has existed long before the term ""hacker""‍—‌with the most notable example of ,Lightning Ellsworth,, it was not a word that the first programmers used to describe themselves. In fact, many of the first programmers were from engineering or physics backgrounds. 
,
,

,
,“
,
,""But from about 1945 onward (and especially during the creation of the first ENIAC computer) some programmers realized that their expertise in computer software and technology had evolved not just into a profession, but into a passion"" (46).,[1],
,
,”
,
,
,
,
,There was a growing awareness of a style of programming different from the cut and dried methods employed at first,,[12],[13], but it was not until the 1960s that the term hackers began to be used to describe proficient computer programmers. Therefore, the fundamental characteristic that links all who identify themselves as hackers are ones who enjoy ""…the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming and circumventing limitations of programming systems and who tries to extend their capabilities"" (47).,[1], With this definition in mind, it can be clear where the negative implications of the word ""hacker"" and the subculture of ""hackers"" came from.
,Some common nicknames among this culture include ""crackers"" who are unskilled thieves who mainly rely on luck. Others include ""phreak""‍—‌which refers to a type of skilled ,crackers, and ""warez d00dz""‍—‌which is a kind of cracker that acquires reproductions of copyrighted software. Within all hackers are tiers of hackers such as the ""samurai"" who are hackers that hire themselves out for legal electronic locksmith work. Furthermore, there are other hackers who are hired to test security, they are called ""sneakers"" or ""tiger teams"".
,Before communications between computers and computer users were as ,networked, as they are now, there were multiple independent and parallel hacker subcultures, often unaware or only partially aware of each other's existence. All of these had certain important traits in common:
,
,Creating software and sharing it with each other,
,Placing a high value on freedom of inquiry,
,Hostility to secrecy,
,Information-sharing as both an ideal and a practical strategy,
,Upholding the right to ,fork,
,Emphasis on rationality,
,Distaste for authority,
,Playful cleverness, taking the serious humorously and humor seriously,
,  ,The ,Glider,, proposed as an ,emblem of the ""hacker community"", by ,Eric S. Raymond,.,[14],
,These sorts of subcultures were commonly found at ,academic, settings such as ,college, ,campuses,. The ,MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,, the ,University of California, Berkeley, and ,Carnegie Mellon University, were particularly well-known hotbeds of early hacker culture. They evolved in parallel, and largely unconsciously, until the ,Internet,, where a legendary ,PDP-10, machine at MIT, called AI, that was running ,ITS,, provided an early meeting point of the hacker community. This and other developments such as the rise of the ,free software movement, and ,community, drew together a critically large population and encouraged the spread of a conscious, common, and systematic ethos. Symptomatic of this evolution were an increasing adoption of ,common slang, and a shared view of history, similar to the way in which other occupational groups have professionalized themselves but without the formal credentialing process characteristic of most professional groups.,[,citation needed,],
,Over time, the academic hacker subculture has tended to become more conscious, more cohesive, and better organized. The most important consciousness-raising moments have included the composition of the first ,Jargon File, in 1973, the promulgation of the ,GNU Manifesto, in 1985, and the publication of ,Eric Raymond,'s ,The Cathedral and the Bazaar, in 1997. Correlated with this has been the gradual recognition of a set of shared culture heroes, including: ,Bill Joy,, ,Donald Knuth,, ,Dennis Ritchie,, ,Alan Kay,, ,Ken Thompson,, ,Richard M. Stallman,, ,Linus Torvalds,, ,Larry Wall,, and ,Guido Van Rossum,.
,The concentration of academic hacker subculture has paralleled and partly been driven by the commoditization of computer and networking technology, and has, in turn, accelerated that process. In 1975, hackerdom was scattered across several different families of ,operating systems, and disparate networks; today it is largely a ,Unix, and ,TCP/IP, phenomenon, and is concentrated around various ,operating systems, based on ,free software, and ,open-source software, development.
,
,Ethics and principles,
,Main article: ,Hacker ethic,
,Many of the values and tenets of the free and open source software movement stem from the ,hacker ethics, that originated at ,MIT,[15], and at the ,Homebrew Computer Club,. The hacker ethics were chronicled by Steven Levy in ,Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution,[16], and in other texts in which Levy formulates and summarizes general hacker attitudes:
,
,Access to computers-and anything that might teach you something about the way the world works-should be unlimited and total.,
,All information should be free.,
,Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.,
,You can create art and beauty on a computer.,
,Computers can change your life for the better.,
,Hacker ethics are concerned primarily with sharing, openness, collaboration, and engaging in the hands-on imperative.,[16],
,Linus Torvalds,, one of the leaders of the open source movement (known primarily for developing the ,Linux kernel,), has noted in the book ,The Hacker Ethic,[17], that these principles have evolved from the known Protestant ethics and incorporates the spirits of capitalism, as introduced in the early 20th century by ,Max Weber,.
,Hack value is the notion used by hackers to express that something is worth doing or is interesting.,[18], This is something that hackers often feel intuitively about a problem or solution.
,An aspect of hack value is performing feats for the sake of showing that they can be done, even if others think it is difficult. Using things in a unique way outside their intended purpose is often perceived as having hack value. Examples are using a ,dot matrix impact printer, to produce musical notes, using a ,flatbed scanner, to take ultra-high-resolution photographs or using an ,optical mouse, as ,barcode reader,.
,A solution or feat has ""hack value"" if it is done in a way that has finesse, cleverness or brilliance, which makes ,creativity, an essential part of the meaning. For example, ,picking a difficult lock, has hack value; smashing it does not. As another example, proving ,Fermat's last theorem, by linking together most of modern mathematics has hack value; solving a combinatorial problem by ,exhaustively trying all possibilities, does not. Hacking is not using process of elimination to find a solution; it's the process of finding a clever solution to a problem.
,
,Uses,
,While using ,hacker, to refer to someone who enjoys playful cleverness is most often applied to computer programmers, it is sometimes used for people who apply the same attitude to other fields.,[8], For example, ,Richard Stallman, describes the silent composition ,4′33″, by John Cage and the 14th-century ,palindromic, three-part piece ""Ma Fin Est Mon Commencement"" by ,Guillaume de Machaut, as hacks.,[3], According to the Jargon File,,[9], the word ,hacker, was used in a similar sense among radio amateurs in the 1950s, predating the software hacking community.
,
,Programming,
,The Boston Globe, in 1984 defined ""hackers"" as ""computer nuts"".,[19], In their programmer subculture, a hacker is a person who follows a spirit of playful cleverness and loves programming. It is found in an originally academic movement unrelated to computer security and most visibly associated with ,free software,, ,open source, and ,demoscene,. It also has a ,hacker ethic,, based on the idea that writing software and sharing the result on a voluntary basis is a good idea, and that information should be free, but that it's not up to the hacker to make it free by breaking into private computer systems. This hacker ethic was publicized and perhaps originated in ,Steven Levy,'s ,Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution, (1984). It contains a codification of its principles.
,The programmer subculture of hackers disassociates from the mass media's pejorative use of the word 'hacker' referring to computer security, and usually prefer the term 'cracker' for that meaning. Complaints about supposed mainstream misuse started as early as 1983, when media used ""hacker"" to refer to the computer criminals involved in ,The 414s, case.,[20],
,In the programmer subculture of hackers, a computer hacker is a person who enjoys designing software and building programs with a sense for aesthetics and playful cleverness. The term hack in this sense can be traced back to ""describe the elaborate college pranks that...students would regularly devise"" (Levy, 1984 p. 10). To be considered a 'hack' was an honor among like-minded peers as ""to qualify as a hack, the feat must be imbued with innovation, style and technical virtuosity"" (Levy, 1984 p. 10) The ,MIT, ,Tech Model Railroad Club, Dictionary defined hack in 1959 (not yet in a computer context) as ""1) an article or project without constructive end; 2) a project undertaken on bad self-advice; 3) an entropy booster; 4) to produce, or attempt to produce, a hack(3)"", and ""hacker"" was defined as ""one who hacks, or makes them"". Much of TMRC's jargon was later imported into early computing culture, because the club started using a ,DEC, ,PDP-1, and applied its local model railroad slang in this computing context. Initially incomprehensible to outsiders, the slang also became popular in MIT's computing environments beyond the club. Other examples of jargon imported from the club are 'losing' (""when a piece of equipment is not working""),[16], and 'munged' (""when a piece of equipment is ruined"").,[16],
,Others did not always view hackers with approval. ,MIT living groups, in 1989 avoided advertising their sophisticated ,Project Athena, workstations to prospective members because they wanted residents who were interested in people, not computers, with one fraternity member stating that ""We were worried about the hacker subculture"".,[21],
,According to ,Eric S. Raymond,,,[22], the Open Source and Free Software hacker subculture developed in the 1960s among 'academic hackers',[23], working on early ,minicomputers, in ,computer science, environments in the United States.
,Hackers were influenced by and absorbed many ideas of key technological developments and the people associated with them. Most notable is the technical culture of the pioneers of the ,Arpanet,, starting in 1969. The ,PDP-10, AI machine at MIT, running the ,ITS, operating system and connected to the Arpanet, provided an early hacker meeting point. After 1980 the subculture coalesced with the culture of ,Unix,. Since the mid-1990s, it has been largely coincident with what is now called the ,free software, and ,open source movement,.
,Many programmers have been labeled ""great hackers"",,[24], but the specifics of who that label applies to is a matter of opinion. Certainly major contributors to ,computer science, such as ,Edsger Dijkstra, and ,Donald Knuth,, as well as the inventors of popular software such as ,Linus Torvalds, (,Linux,), and ,Ken Thompson, and ,Dennis Ritchie, (,Unix, and ,C programming language,) are likely to be included in any such list; see also ,List of programmers,. People primarily known for their contributions to the consciousness of the programmer subculture of hackers include ,Richard Stallman,, the founder of the free software movement and the ,GNU project,, president of the ,Free Software Foundation, and author of the famous ,Emacs, text editor as well as the ,GNU Compiler Collection (GCC),, and ,Eric S. Raymond,, one of the founders of the ,Open Source Initiative, and writer of the famous text ,The Cathedral and the Bazaar, and many other essays, maintainer of the ,Jargon File, (which was previously maintained by ,Guy L. Steele, Jr.,).
,Within the computer programmer subculture of hackers, the term hacker is also used for a programmer who reaches a goal by employing a series of modifications to extend existing ,code, or resources. In this sense, it can have a negative connotation of using inelegant ,kludges, to accomplish programming tasks that are quick, but ugly, inelegant, difficult to extend, hard to maintain and inefficient. This derogatory form of the noun "",hack,"" derives from the everyday English sense ""to cut or shape by or as if by crude or ruthless strokes"" [Merriam-Webster] and is even used among users of the positive sense of ""hacker"" who produces ""cool"" or ""neat"" hacks. In other words, to ""hack"" at an original creation, as if with an axe, is to force-fit it into being usable for a task not intended by the original creator, and a ""hacker"" would be someone who does this habitually. (The original creator and the hacker may be the same person.) This usage is common in both programming, engineering and building. In programming, hacking in this sense appears to be tolerated and seen as a necessary compromise in many situations. Some argue that it should not be, due to this negative meaning; others argue that some kludges can, for all their ugliness and imperfection, still have ""hack value"".
,In non-software engineering, the culture is less tolerant of unmaintainable solutions, even when intended to be temporary, and describing someone as a ""hacker"" might imply that they lack professionalism. In this sense, the term has no real positive connotations, except for the idea that the hacker is capable of doing modifications that allow a system to work in the short term, and so has some sort of marketable skills. However, there is always the understanding that a more skillful or technical logician could have produced successful modifications that would not be considered a ""hack-job"". The definition is similar to other, non-computer based uses of the term ""hack-job"". For instance, a professional modification of a production sports car into a racing machine would not be considered a hack-job, but a cobbled together backyard mechanic's result could be. Even though the outcome of a race of the two machines could not be assumed, a quick inspection would instantly reveal the difference in the level of professionalism of the designers. The adjective associated with hacker is ""hackish"" (see the ,Jargon file,).
,In a very universal sense, hacker also means someone who makes things work beyond perceived limits in a clever way in general, without necessarily referring to computers, especially at MIT.,[25], That is, people who apply the creative attitude of software hackers in fields other than computing. This includes even activities that predate computer hacking, for example ,reality hackers, or ,urban spelunkers, (exploring undocumented or unauthorized areas in buildings). One specific example is clever pranks,[26], traditionally perpetrated by MIT students, with the perpetrator being called hacker. For example, when MIT students surreptitiously put a fake police car atop the dome on MIT's Building 10,,[27], that was a hack in this sense, and the students involved were therefore hackers. Other types of hacking are ,reality hackers,, ,wetware, hackers (""hack your brain""), and ,media hackers, (""hack your reputation""). In a similar vein, a ""hack"" may refer to a ,math, hack, that is, a clever solution to a mathematical problem. All of these uses have spread beyond MIT.
,
,Home computing enthusiasts,
,Main article: ,Hacking of consumer electronics,
,In yet another context, a hacker is a computer hobbyist who pushes the limits of software or hardware. The home computer hacking subculture relates to the hobbyist home computing of the late 1970s, beginning with the availability of ,MITS Altair,. An influential organization was the ,Homebrew Computer Club,. However, its roots go back further to ,amateur radio, enthusiasts. The amateur radio slang referred to creatively tinkering to improve performance as ""hacking"" already in the 1950s.,[28],
,A large overlaps between hobbyist hackers and the programmer subculture hackers existed during the Homebrew Club's days, but the interests and values of both communities somewhat diverged. Today, the hobbyists focus on commercial ,computer and video games,, ,software cracking, and exceptional computer programming (,demo scene,). Also of interest to some members of this group is the modification of computer hardware and other electronic devices, see ,modding,.
,
,  ,A ,DIY, musician probes the circuit board of a synthesizer for ,""bends"", using a jeweler's screwdriver and alligator clips,
,Electronics hobbyists working on machines other than computers also fall into this category. This includes people who do simple modifications to ,graphing calculators,, ,video game consoles,, electronic ,musical keyboards, or other device (see ,CueCat, for a notorious example) to expose or add functionality to a device that was unintended for use by end users by the company who created it. A number of ,techno, musicians have modified 1980s-era ,Casio SK-1, sampling keyboards to create unusual sounds by doing ,circuit bending,: connecting wires to different leads of the integrated circuit chips. The results of these DIY experiments range from opening up previously inaccessible features that were part of the chip design to producing the strange, dis-harmonic digital tones that became part of the techno music style.
Companies take different attitudes towards such practices, ranging from open acceptance (such as ,Texas Instruments, for its graphing calculators and ,Lego, for its ,Lego Mindstorms, robotics gear) to outright hostility (such as ,Microsoft,'s attempts to lock out ,Xbox, hackers or the ,DRM, routines on ,Blu-ray Disc, players designed to sabotage compromised players.,[,citation needed,],)
,In this context, a ""hack"" refers to a ,program, that (sometimes illegally) modifies another program, often a video game, giving the user access to features otherwise inaccessible to them. As an example of this use, for ,Palm OS, users (until the 4th iteration of this ,operating system,), a ""hack"" refers to an extension of the operating system which provides additional functionality. Term also refers to those people who cheat on video games using special software. This can also refer to the ,jailbreaking, of ,iPhones,.
,
,Hacker artists,
,See also: ,Fractal art,, ,algorithmic art,, and ,interactive art,
,Hacker artists create ,art, by hacking on ,technology, as an ,artistic medium,. This has extended the definition of the term and what it means to be a hacker. Such ,artists, may work with ,graphics,, ,computer hardware,, ,sculpture,, ,music, and other ,audio,, ,animation,, ,video,, ,software,, ,simulations,, ,mathematics,, reactive ,sensory, systems, text, ,poetry,, ,literature,, or any combination thereof.
,Dartmouth College, musician Larry Polansky states:
,
,Technology and art are inextricably related. Many musicians, video artists, graphic artists, and even poets who work with technology—whether designing it or using it—consider themselves to be part of the 'hacker community.' Computer artists, like non-art hackers, often find themselves on society’s fringes, developing strange, innovative uses of existing technology. There is an empathetic relationship between those, for example, who design experimental music software and hackers who write communications ,freeware,.,[29],
,
,Another description is offered by Jenny Marketou: 
,
,Hacker artists operate as ,culture, hackers who manipulate existing techno-,semiotic, structures towards a different end, to get inside cultural systems on the net and make them do things they were never intended to do.,[30],
,
,A successful software and hardware hacker artist is ,Mark Lottor, (mkl), who has created the 3-D light art projects entitled the ,Cubatron,, and the ,Big Round Cubatron,. This art is made using custom computer technology, with specially designed ,circuit boards, and programming for ,microprocessor, chips to manipulate the ,LED, lights.
,
,Don Hopkins, is a software hacker artist well known for his artistic cellular automata. This art, created by a ,cellular automata, computer program, generates objects which randomly bump into each other and in turn create more objects and designs, similar to a lava lamp, except that the parts change color and form through interaction. Hopkins Says: ,Cellular automata are simple rules that are applied to a grid of cells, or the pixel values of an image. The same rule is applied to every cell, to determine its next state, based on the previous state of that cell and its neighboring cells. There are many interesting cellular automata rules, and they all look very different, with amazing animated dynamic effects. ',Life,' is a widely known cellular automata rule, but many other lesser known rules are much more interesting.
,
,Some hacker artists create art by writing computer code, and others, by developing hardware. Some create with existing software tools such as ,Adobe Photoshop, or ,GIMP,.
,The creative process of hacker artists can be more abstract than artists using non-technological media. For example, ,mathematicians, have produced visually stunning graphic presentations of ,fractals,, which hackers have further enhanced, often producing detailed and intricate graphics and animations from simple mathematical formulas.

,Early life,[,edit,],
,Raymond was born in ,Boston, Massachusetts,, in 1957 and lived in Venezuela as a child. His family moved to ,Pennsylvania, in 1971.,[5], He has suffered from ,cerebral palsy, since birth; his weakened physical condition motivated him to go into computing.,[6],
,
,Career,[,edit,],
,Raymond began his programming career writing proprietary software, between 1980 and 1985.,[1], In 1990, noting that the ,Jargon File, had not been maintained since about 1983, he adopted it; he currently has a third edition in print. ,Paul Dourish, maintains an archived original version of the Jargon File, because, he says, Raymond's updates ""essentially destroyed what held it together."",[7],
,In 1996 Raymond took over development of the open-source email software ""popclient"", renaming it to ,Fetchmail,.,[8], Soon after this experience, in 1997, he wrote the essay "",The Cathedral and the Bazaar,"", detailing his thoughts on ,open-source software development, and why it should be done as openly as possible (i.e., the ""bazaar"" approach). The essay was based in part on his experience in developing Fetchmail. He first presented his thesis at the annual ,Linux Kongress, on May 27, 1997. He later expanded the essay into a book, ,The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary,, in 1999. The internal white paper by Frank Hecker that led to the release of the ,Mozilla, (then ,Netscape,) source code in 1998 cited ,The Cathedral and the Bazaar, as ""independent validation"" of ideas proposed by ,Eric Hahn, and ,Jamie Zawinski,.,[9], Hahn would later describe the 1999 book as ""clearly influential"".,[10],:,190,
,From the late 1990s onward, due in part to the popularity of his essay, Raymond became a prominent voice in the open source movement. He co-founded the ,Open Source Initiative, in 1998, taking on the self-appointed role of ambassador of ,open source, to the press, business and public. He remains active in OSI, and stepped down as president of the initiative in February 2005.,[11],  In 1998 Raymond received and published a Microsoft document expressing worry about the quality of rival open-source software.,[12], Eric named this document, together with others subsequently leaked, "",the ,Halloween Documents,"".
,In 2000–2002 he wrote a number of ,HOWTOs, still included in the ,Linux Documentation Project,[,citation needed,],. His personal archive also lists a number of non-technical and very early non-Linux FAQs,[,citation needed,],. At this time he also created ,CML2,, a source code configuration system; while originally intended for the ,Linux operating system,, it was rejected by kernel developers.,[13], Raymond attributed this rejection to ""kernel list politics"".,[14], ,Linus Torvalds, on the other hand said in a 2007 mailing list ,post, that as a matter of policy, the development team preferred more incremental changes. His 2003 book ,The Art of Unix Programming, discusses user tools for programming and other tasks.
,Raymond is currently the administrator of the project page for the GPS data tool ,gpsd,.,[15], Also, some versions of ,NetHack, include his guide.,[3], He has also contributed code and content to the free software video game ,The Battle for Wesnoth,.,[16],

,Raymond coined an ,aphorism, he dubbed "",Linus's Law,"", inspired by ,Linus Torvalds,: ""Given enough eyeballs, all ,bugs, are shallow"".,[17], It first appeared in his book ,The Cathedral and the Bazaar,.,[18],:,30,
,Raymond has refused to speculate on whether the ""bazaar"" development model could be applied to works such as books and music, not wanting to ""weaken the winning argument for open-sourcing software by tying it to a potential loser"".,[19],
,Raymond has had a number of public ,disputes, with other figures in the ,free software movement,. As head of the Open Source Initiative, he argued that advocates should focus on the potential for better products. The ""very seductive"" moral and ethical rhetoric of ,Richard Stallman, and the ,Free Software Foundation, fails, he said, ""not because his principles are wrong, but because that kind of language ... simply does not persuade anybody"".,[20],
,In a 2008 essay he ""defended the right of programmers to issue work under proprietary licenses because I think that if a programmer wants to write a program and sell it, it's neither my business nor anyone else's but his customer's what the terms of sale are"".,[21], In the same essay he also said that the ""logic of the system"" puts developers into ""dysfunctional roles"", with bad code the result.
,
,Political beliefs and activism,[,edit,],
,Raymond is a member of the ,Libertarian Party,. He is a ,gun rights, advocate.,[22], He has endorsed the open source firearms organization ,Defense Distributed,, calling them ""friends of freedom"" and writing ""I approve of any development that makes it more difficult for governments and criminals to monopolize the use of force. As 3D printers become less expensive and more ubiquitous, this could be a major step in the right direction."",[23],[24],
,In 2015 Raymond accused the ,Ada Initiative, and other ,women in tech, groups of attempting to entrap male open source leaders and accuse them of rape, saying ""Try to avoid even being alone, ever, because there is a chance that a 'women in tech' advocacy group is going to try to collect your scalp."",[25],[26],
,Raymond is also known for claiming that “Gays experimented with unfettered promiscuity in the 1970s and got AIDS as a consequence” and that “Police who react to a random black male behaving suspiciously who might be in the critical age range as though he is an near-imminent lethal threat, are being rational, not racist.”,[27],[28], Progressive campaign The Great Slate was successful in raising funds for candidates in part by asking for contributions from tech workers in return for not posting similar quotes by Raymond. ,Matasano Security, employee and Great Slate fundraiser Thomas Ptacek said, “I’ve been torturing Twitter with lurid Eric S. Raymond quotes for years. Every time I do, 20 people beg me to stop.” It is estimated that as of March 2018 over $30,000 has been raised in this way.,[29],
,
,Personal life,[,edit,],
,Raymond describes himself as ,neo-pagan,.,[6],

",Eric S. Raymond,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond
" 19 November 2018, at 16:13",""",Homesteading the Noosphere,"" (abbreviated ,HtN,) is an ,essay, written by ,Eric S. Raymond, about the social workings of ,open-source, ,software development,. It follows his previous piece "",The Cathedral and the Bazaar,"" (1997).
,The essay examines issues of ,project, ownership and transfer, as well as investigating possible ,anthropological, roots of the ,gift culture, in open source as contrasted with the exchange culture of ,closed source, software. Raymond also investigates the nature of the spread of open source into the untamed frontier of ideas he terms the ,noosphere,, postulating that projects that range too far ahead of their time fail because they are too far out in the wilderness, and that successful projects tend to relate to existing projects.
,Raymond delves into the contrast between the stated aims of open source and observed behaviors, and also explores the underlying motivations of people involved in the ,open source movement,. He seems to settle on the idea that open-source practitioners find striving for a great ,reputation, within the ""tribe"" a key motivational feature.

Kahn, as an ""activities center around strategic development of network-based information technologies"", including the ,National Information Infrastructure, (NII) in the ,United States,.,[1],

,History,[,edit,],
,CNRI formerly operated the Secretariat of the ,Internet Engineering Task Force,.,[4], ,Guido van Rossum,, pioneer for open source software and creator of Python, at one time worked for this company. The formation and early funding of the ,Internet Society, were led by CNRI. At the first meeting of the Internet Society board, Vint Cerf, representing CNRI, offered, ""In the event a deficit occurs, CNRI has agreed to contribute up to USD102000 to offset it."",[5], In the event, the contribution was not needed. CNRI did cover many of the expenses of the Internet Society in 1992. They also paid Cerf's salary during 1993, when much of his time was devoted to building the Internet Society.,[6],
,
,Handle System,[,edit,],
,In 1996, the ,Association of American Publishers, announced that ,R.R. Bowker, and the CNRI had been selected to design a ,Digital Object Identifier, system. The effort was initiated after a year-long study of the need for a system to identify electronic copyright ownership and to manage the digital purchase of rights.,[7],  The CNRI Handle system was first demonstrated at a February 1997 meeting of the Professional/Scholarly Publishing (PSP) division of the AAP meeting in Washington, DC.,[8], The ,Handle System, is a technology specification for assigning, managing, and resolving ,persistent identifiers, for digital objects and other resources on the Internet. The DONA System is under consideration at the ,ITU,[9], and has been adopted by several countries.,[10],
,
,D-Lib,[,edit,],
,D-Lib Magazine, was an on-line magazine dedicated to digital library research and development, produced by CNRI.
,
,Software,[,edit,],
,DO Repository and DO Registry,[,edit,],
,CNRI developed the Digital Object (DO) Repository software, with digital object architecture which provides a mechanism for the creation of, and access to, digital objects as discrete data structures with unique, resolvable identifiers.,[11],

,

,History,[,edit,],
,Elm was initially designed by Evan Czaplicki as his thesis in 2012.,[5], The first release of Elm came with many examples and an online editor that made it easy to try out in a ,web browser,.,[6], Evan Czaplicki joined ,Prezi, in 2013 to work on Elm,,[7], and in 2016 moved to ,NoRedInk, as an Open Source Engineer, also starting the Elm Software Foundation.,[8],
,The initial implementation of the Elm compiler targets ,HTML,, ,CSS,, and ,JavaScript,.,[9], The set of core tools has continued to expand, now including a ,REPL,,,[10], ,package manager,,,[11], time-traveling debugger,,[12], and installers for Mac and Windows.,[13], Elm also has an ecosystem of community created libraries,[14], and an advanced online editor that allows saved work and inclusion of community libraries.,[15],
,
,Features,[,edit,],
,Elm has a small but expressive set of language constructs, including traditional if-expressions, let-expressions for local state, and case-expressions for ,pattern matching,.,[16], As a functional language, it supports anonymous functions, functions as arguments, and partial application (,currying,) by default. Its semantics include immutable values, ,stateless functions,, and static typing with type inference. Elm programs render HTML through a virtual DOM, and may interoperate with other code by using ""JavaScript as a service"".
,
,Immutability,[,edit,],
,All values in Elm are ,immutable,, meaning that a value cannot be modified after it is created. Elm uses ,persistent data structures, to implement its ,Array,, ,Dict,, and ,Set, libraries.,[17],
,
,Static types,[,edit,],
,Elm is statically typed. Type annotations are optional (due to type inference) but strongly encouraged. Annotations exist on the line above the definition (unlike C-family languages where types and names are interspersed). Elm uses a single colon to mean ""has type"".
,Types include primitives like integers and strings, and basic data structures such as lists, tuples, and records. Functions have types written with arrows, for example ,round : Float -> Int,. ,Union types, allow the programmer to create custom types to represent data in a way that matches the problem domain.,[18],
,Types can refer to other types, for example a ,List Int,. Types are always capitalized; lowercase names are type variables. For example, a ,List a, is a list of values of unknown type. It is the type of the empty list and of the argument to ,List.length,, which is agnostic to the list's elements. There are a few special types that programmers create to interact with the Elm runtime. For example, ,Html Msg, represents a (virtual) DOM tree whose event handlers all produce messages of type ,Msg,.
,Rather than allow any value to be implicitly nullable (such a JavaScript's ,undefined, or a ,null pointer,), Elm's standard library defines a ,Maybe a, type. Code that produces or handles an optional value does so explicitly using this type, and all other code is guaranteed a value of the claimed type is actually present.
,
,Module system,[,edit,],
,Elm has a ,module system, that allows users to break their code into smaller parts called modules. Modules can hide implementation details such as helper functions, and group related code together. Modules serve as a namespace for imported code, such as ,Bitwise.and,. Third party libraries (or packages) consist of one or more modules, and are available from the ,Elm Public Library,. All libraries are versioned according to ,semver,, which is enforced by the compiler and other tools. That is, removing a function or changing its type can only be done in a major release.
,
,Interoperability with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,[,edit,],
,Elm uses an abstraction called ports to communicate with ,JavaScript,.,[19], It allows values to flow in and out of Elm programs, making it possible to communicate between Elm and JavaScript.
,Elm has a library called elm-html that a programmer can use to write HTML and CSS within Elm.,[20], It uses a virtual ,DOM, approach to make updates efficient.,[21],
,
,Limitations,[,edit,],
,Unlike ,Haskell, or PureScript, Elm has no support for ,higher-kinded types,, and thus cannot provide generic abstractions for many common operations.,[22], For example, there is no generic ,map,, ,apply,, ,fold,, or ,filter, function. Instead, such names are used prefixed by their module, such as ,List.map, and ,Dict.map,.

,History,[,edit,],
,  ,Guido van Rossum OSCON 2006 cropped,
,Main article: ,History of Python,
,Python was conceived in the late 1980s,[31], by ,Guido van Rossum, at ,Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, (CWI) in the ,Netherlands, as a successor to the ,ABC language, (itself inspired by ,SETL,),[32],, capable of ,exception handling, and interfacing with the ,Amoeba, operating system.,[7], Its implementation began in December 1989.,[33], Van Rossum's long influence on Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community: ,Benevolent Dictator For Life, (BDFL) –  a post from which he gave himself permanent vacation on July 12, 2018.,[34],
,Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 with many major new features, including a ,cycle-detecting, ,garbage collector, and support for ,Unicode,.,[35],
,Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely ,backward-compatible,.,[36], Many of its major features were ,backported, to Python 2.6.x,[37], and 2.7.x version series.  Releases of Python 3 include the ,2to3, utility, which automates (at least partially) the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.,[38],
,Python 2.7's ,end-of-life, date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.,[39],[40], In January 2017, Google announced work on a Python 2.7 to ,Go, ,transcompiler, to improve performance under concurrent workloads.,[41],
,
,Features and philosophy,[,edit,],
,Python is a ,multi-paradigm programming language,. ,Object-oriented programming, and ,structured programming, are fully supported, and many of its features support ,functional programming, and ,aspect-oriented programming, (including by ,metaprogramming,[42], and ,metaobjects, (magic methods)).,[43], Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including ,design by contract,[44],[45], and ,logic programming,.,[46],
,Python uses ,dynamic typing,, and a combination of ,reference counting, and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for ,memory management,. It also features dynamic ,name resolution, (,late binding,), which binds method and variable names during program execution.
,Python's design offers some support for ,functional programming, in the ,Lisp, tradition. It has ,filter(),, ,map(),, and ,reduce(), functions; ,list comprehensions,, ,dictionaries,, and sets; and ,generator, expressions.,[47], The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from ,Haskell, and ,Standard ML,.,[48],
,The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document ,The ,Zen of Python, (,PEP 20,), which includes ,aphorisms, such as:,[49],
,
,Beautiful is better than ugly,
,Explicit is better than implicit,
,Simple is better than complex,
,Complex is better than complicated,
,Readability counts,
,Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly ,extensible,. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ,ABC,, which espoused the opposite approach.,[31],
,While offering choice in coding methodology, the Python philosophy rejects exuberant syntax (such as that of ,Perl,) in favor of a simpler, less-cluttered grammar. As ,Alex Martelli, put it: ""To describe something as 'clever' is ,not, considered a compliment in the Python culture."",[50], Python's philosophy rejects the Perl "",there is more than one way to do it,"" approach to language design in favor of ""there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it"".,[49],
,Python's developers strive to avoid ,premature optimization,, and reject patches to non-critical parts of CPython that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity.,[51], When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or use ,PyPy,, a ,just-in-time compiler,. ,Cython, is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.
,An important goal of Python's developers is keeping it fun to use. This is reflected in the language's name—a tribute to the British comedy group ,Monty Python,[52],—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs (from a ,famous Monty Python sketch,) instead of the standard ,foo and bar,.,[53],[54],
,A common ,neologism, in the Python community is ,pythonic,, which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called ,unpythonic,.
,Users and admirers of Python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as ,Pythonists,, ,Pythonistas,, and ,Pythoneers,.,[55],[56],
,
,Syntax and semantics,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Python syntax and semantics,
,Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use ,curly brackets, to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are optional. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than ,C, or ,Pascal,.,[57],
,
,Indentation,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Python syntax and semantics § Indentation,
,Python uses ,whitespace, indentation, rather than ,curly brackets, or keywords, to delimit ,blocks,. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block.,[58], Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents the program's semantic structure.,[1], This feature is also sometimes termed the ,off-side rule,.
,
,Statements and control flow,[,edit,],
,Python's ,statements, include (among others):
,
,The assignment statement (token '=', the equals sign). This operates differently than in traditional ,imperative programming, languages, and this fundamental mechanism (including the nature of Python's version of ,variables,) illuminates many other features of the language. Assignment in ,C,, e.g., ,x = 2,, translates to ""typed variable name x receives a copy of numeric value 2"". The (right-hand) value is copied into an ,allocated storage location, for which the (left-hand) ,variable name, is the symbolic address. The memory allocated to the variable is large enough (potentially quite large) for the declared ,type,. In the simplest case of Python assignment, using the same example, ,x = 2,, translates to ""(generic) name x receives a ,reference, to a separate, dynamically allocated ,object, of numeric (int) type of value 2."" This is termed ,binding, the name to the object. Since the name's storage location doesn't ,contain, the indicated value, it is improper to call it a ,variable,. Names may be subsequently rebound at any time to objects of greatly varying types, including strings, procedures, complex objects with data and methods, etc. Successive assignments of a common value to multiple names, e.g., ,x = 2,; ,y = 2,; ,z = 2, result in allocating storage to (at most) three names and one numeric object, to which all three names are bound. Since a name is a generic reference holder it is unreasonable to associate a fixed ,data type, with it. However at a given time a name will be bound to ,some, object, which ,will, have a type; thus there is ,dynamic typing,.,
,The ,if, statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with ,else, and ,elif, (a contraction of else-if).,
,The ,for, statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block.,
,The ,while, statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true.,
,The ,try, statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by ,except, clauses; it also ensures that clean-up code in a ,finally, block will always be run regardless of how the block exits.,
,The ,raise, statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception.,
,The ,class, statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a ,class,, for use in ,object-oriented programming,.,
,The ,def, statement, which defines a ,function, or ,method,.,
,The ,with, statement, from Python 2.5 released on September 2006,,[59], which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a ,lock, before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a ,file, and then closing it), allowing ,Resource Acquisition Is Initialization, (RAII)-like behavior and replaces a common try/finally idiom.,[60],
,The ,pass, statement, which serves as a ,NOP,. It is syntactically needed to create an empty code block.,
,The ,assert, statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that ought to apply.,
,The ,yield, statement, which returns a value from a ,generator, function. From Python 2.5, ,yield, is also an operator. This form is used to implement ,coroutines,.,
,The ,import, statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program. There are three ways of using import: ,import <module name> [as <alias>], or ,from <module name> import *, or ,from <module name> import <definition 1> [as <alias 1>], <definition 2> [as <alias 2>], ...,.,
,The ,print, statement was changed to the ,print(), function in Python 3.,[61],
,
Python does not support ,tail call, optimization or ,first-class continuations,, and, according to Guido van Rossum, it never will.,[62],[63], However, better support for ,coroutine,-like functionality is provided in 2.5, by extending Python's ,generators,.,[64], Before 2.5, generators were ,lazy, ,iterators,; information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5, it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and from Python 3.3, the information can be passed through multiple stack levels.,[65],
,
,Expressions,[,edit,],
,Some Python ,expressions, are similar to languages such as ,C, and ,Java,, while some are not:
,
,Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of divisions in Python. They are floor division and integer division.,[66], Python also added the ,**, operator for exponentiation.,
,From Python 3.5, the new ,@, infix operator was introduced. It is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for ,matrix multiplication,.,[67],[68],
,In Python, ,==, compares by value, versus Java, which compares numerics by value,[69], and objects by reference.,[70], (Value comparisons in Java on objects can be performed with the ,equals(), method.) Python's ,is, operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference). In Python, comparisons may be chained, for example ,a <= b <= c,.,
,Python uses the words ,and,, ,or,, ,not, for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic ,&&,, ,||,, ,!, used in Java and C.,
,Python has a type of expression termed a ,list comprehension,. Python 2.4 extended list comprehensions into a more general expression termed a ,generator, expression,.,[47],
,Anonymous functions, are implemented using ,lambda expressions,; however, these are limited in that the body can only be one expression.,
,Conditional expressions in Python are written as ,x if c else y,[71], (different in order of operands from the ,c ? x : y, operator common to many other languages).,
,Python makes a distinction between ,lists, and ,tuples,. Lists are written as ,[1, 2, 3],, are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must be ,immutable, in Python). Tuples are written as ,(1, 2, 3),, are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. The ,+, operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples. Thus, given the variable ,t, initially equal to ,(1, 2, 3),, executing ,t = t + (4, 5), first evaluates ,t + (4, 5),, which yields ,(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),, which is then assigned back to ,t,, thereby effectively ""modifying the contents"" of ,t,, while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.,[72],
,Python features ,sequence unpacking, where multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to (a variable, a writable property, etc.), are associated in the identical manner to that forming tuple literals and, as a whole, are put on the left hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. The statement expects an ,iterable, object on the right hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through, and will iterate through it, assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left.,[73],
,Python has a ""string format"" operator ,%,. This functions analogous to ,printf, format strings in ,C,, e.g. ,""spam=%s eggs=%d"" % (""blah"", 2), evaluates to ,""spam=blah eggs=2"",. In Python 3 and 2.6+, this was supplemented by the ,format(), method of the ,str, class, e.g. ,""spam={0} eggs={1}"".format(""blah"", 2),. Python 3.6 added ""f-strings"": ,blah = ""blah""; eggs = 2; f'spam={blah} eggs={eggs}',.,[74],
,Python has various kinds of ,string literals,:
,Strings delimited by single or double quote marks. Unlike in ,Unix shells,, ,Perl, and Perl-influenced languages, single quote marks and double quote marks function identically. Both kinds of string use the backslash (,\,) as an ,escape character,. ,String interpolation, became available in Python 3.6 as ""formatted string literals"".,[74],
,Triple-quoted strings, which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks. They may span multiple lines and function like ,here documents, in shells, Perl and ,Ruby,.,
,Raw string, varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with an ,r,. Escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as ,regular expressions, and ,Windows,-style paths. Compare "",@,-quoting"" in ,C#,.,
,Python has ,array index, and ,array slicing, expressions on lists, denoted as ,a[key],, ,a[start:stop], or ,a[start:stop:step],. Indexes are ,zero-based,, and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the ,start, index up to, but not including, the ,stop, index. The third slice parameter, called ,step, or ,stride,, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted, for example ,a[:], returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a ,shallow copy,.,
,In Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as ,Common Lisp,, ,Scheme,, or ,Ruby,. This leads to duplicating some functionality. For example:
,
,List comprehensions, vs. ,for,-loops,
,Conditional, expressions vs. ,if, blocks,
,The ,eval(), vs. ,exec(), built-in functions (in Python 2, ,exec, is a statement); the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements.,
,Statements cannot be a part of an expression, so list and other comprehensions or ,lambda expressions,, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. A particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as ,a = 1, cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C error of mistaking an assignment operator ,=, for an equality operator ,==, in conditions: ,if (c = 1) { ... }, is syntactically valid (but probably unintended) C code but ,if c = 1: ..., causes a syntax error in Python.
,
,Methods,[,edit,],
,Methods, on objects are ,functions, attached to the object's class; the syntax ,instance.method(argument), is, for normal methods and functions, ,syntactic sugar, for ,Class.method(instance, argument),. Python methods have an explicit ,self, parameter to access ,instance data,, in contrast to the implicit ,self, (or ,this,) in some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g., ,C++,, ,Java,, ,Objective-C,, or ,Ruby,).,[75],
,
,Typing,[,edit,],
,  ,
,Python uses ,duck typing, and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at ,compile time,; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type. Despite being ,dynamically typed,, Python is ,strongly typed,, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them.
,Python allows programmers to define their own types using ,classes,, which are most often used for ,object-oriented programming,. New ,instances, of classes are constructed by calling the class (for example, ,SpamClass(), or ,EggsClass(),), and the classes are instances of the ,metaclass, ,type, (itself an instance of itself), allowing ,metaprogramming, and ,reflection,.
,Before version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes: ,old-style, and ,new-style,.,[76], The syntax of both styles is the same, the difference being whether the class ,object, is inherited from, directly or indirectly (all new-style classes inherit from ,object, and are instances of ,type,). In versions of Python 2 from Python 2.2 onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. Old-style classes were eliminated in Python 3.0.
,The long term plan is to support ,gradual typing,[77], and from Python 3.5, the syntax of the language allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation, CPython. An experimental optional static type checker named ,mypy, supports compile-time type checking.,[78],

,Mathematics,[,edit,],
,Python has the usual C language arithmetic operators (,+,, ,-,, ,*,, ,/,, ,%,). It also has ,**, for exponentiation, e.g. ,5**3 == 125, and ,9**0.5 == 3.0,, and a new matrix multiply ,@, operator is included in version 3.5.,[80], Additionally, it has a unary operator (,~,), which essentially inverts all the bits of its one argument. For integers, this means ,~x=-x-1,.,[81], Other operators include bitwise shift operators ,x << y,, which shifts ,x, to the left ,y, places, the same as ,x*(2**y) ,, and ,x >> y,, which shifts ,x, to the right ,y, places, the same as ,x//(2**y) ,.,[82],
,The behavior of division has changed significantly over time:,[83],[,why?,],
,
,Python 2.1 and earlier use the C division behavior. The ,/, operator is integer division if both operands are integers, and floating-point division otherwise. Integer division rounds towards 0, e.g. ,7/3 == 2, and ,-7/3 == -2,.,
,Python 2.2 changes integer division to round towards negative infinity, e.g. ,7/3 == 2, and ,-7/3 == -3,. The floor division ,//, operator is introduced. So ,7//3 == 2,, ,-7//3 == -3,, ,7.5//3 == 2.0, and ,-7.5//3 == -3.0,. Adding ,from __future__ import division, causes a module to use Python 3.0 rules for division (see next).,
,Python 3.0 changes ,/, to be always floating-point division. In Python terms, the pre-3.0 ,/, is ,classic division,, the version-3.0 ,/, is ,real division,, and ,//, is ,floor division,.,
,Rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. For instance, it means that the equation ,(a + b)//b == a//b + 1, is always true. It also means that the equation ,b*(a//b) + a%b == a, is valid for both positive and negative values of ,a,. However, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of ,a%b, is, as expected, in the ,half-open interval, [0, ,b,), where ,b, is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval (,b,, 0] when ,b, is negative.,[84],
,Python provides a ,round, function for ,rounding, a float to the nearest integer. For ,tie-breaking,, versions before 3 use round-away-from-zero: ,round(0.5), is 1.0, ,round(-0.5), is −1.0.,[85], Python 3 uses ,round to even,: ,round(1.5), is 2, ,round(2.5), is 2.,[86],
,Python allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression ,a < b < c, tests whether ,a, is less than ,b, and ,b, is less than ,c,.,[87],  C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate ,a < b,, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with ,c,.,[88],
,Python has extensive built-in support for ,arbitrary precision arithmetic,. Integers are transparently switched from the machine-supported maximum fixed-precision (usually 32 or 64 bits), belonging to the python type ,int,, to arbitrary precision, belonging to the Python type ,long,, where needed. The latter have an ""L"" suffix in their textual representation.,[89], (In Python 3, the distinction between the ,int, and ,long, types was eliminated; this behavior is now entirely contained by the ,int, class.) The ,Decimal, type/class in module ,decimal, (since version 2.4) provides decimal floating point numbers to arbitrary precision and several rounding modes.,[90], The ,Fraction, type in module ,fractions, (since version 2.6) provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers.,[91],
,Due to Python's extensive mathematics library, and the third-party library ,NumPy, that further extends the native capabilities, it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation.,[,citation needed,],
,
,Libraries,[,edit,],
,Python's large ,standard library,, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths,,[92], provides tools suited to many tasks. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as ,MIME, and ,HTTP, are supported. It includes modules for creating ,graphical user interfaces,, connecting to ,relational databases,, ,generating pseudorandom numbers,, arithmetic with arbitrary precision decimals,,[93], manipulating ,regular expressions,, and ,unit testing,.
,Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications (for example, the ,Web Server Gateway Interface, (WSGI) implementation ,wsgiref, follows PEP 333,[94],), but most modules are not. They are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites (if supplied). However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations.
,As of  March 2018,,[update], the ,Python Package Index, (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software, contains over 130,000,[95], packages with a wide range of functionality, including:
,
,Graphical user interfaces,
,Web frameworks,
,Multimedia,
,Databases,
,Networking,
,Test frameworks,
,Automation,
,Web scraping,[96],
,Documentation,
,System administration,
,Scientific computing,
,Text processing,
,Image processing,
,Development environments,[,edit,],
,See also: ,Comparison of integrated development environments § Python,
,Most Python implementations (including CPython) include a ,read–eval–print loop, (REPL), permitting them to function as a ,command line interpreter, for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives results immediately.
,Other shells, including ,IDLE, and ,IPython,, add further abilities such as auto-completion, session state retention and ,syntax highlighting,.
,As well as standard desktop ,integrated development environments,, there are ,Web browser,-based IDEs; ,SageMath, (intended for developing science and math-related Python programs); ,PythonAnywhere,, a browser-based IDE and hosting environment; and Canopy IDE, a commercial Python IDE emphasizing scientific computing.,[97],
,
,Implementations,[,edit,],
,See also: ,List of Python software § Python implementations,
,Reference implementation,[,edit,],
,CPython, is the ,reference implementation, of Python. It is written in ,C,, meeting the ,C89, standard with several select ,C99, features.,[98], It compiles Python programs into an intermediate ,bytecode,[99], which is then executed by its ,virtual machine,.,[100], CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of C and native Python. It is available for many platforms, including ,Windows, and most modern ,Unix-like, systems. Platform portability was one of its earliest priorities.,[101],
,
,Other implementations,[,edit,],
,PyPy, is a fast, compliant,[102], interpreter of Python 2.7 and 3.5. Its ,just-in-time compiler, brings a significant speed improvement over CPython.,[103],
,Stackless Python, is a significant fork of CPython that implements ,microthreads,; it does not use the C memory stack, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. PyPy also has a stackless version.,[104],
,MicroPython, and ,CircuitPython, are Python 3 variants optimised for ,microcontrollers,.
,
,Unsupported implementations,[,edit,],
,Other just-in-time Python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported:
,
,Google began a project named ,Unladen Swallow, in 2009 with the aim of speeding up the Python interpreter fivefold by using the ,LLVM,, and of improving its multithreading ability to scale to thousands of cores.,[105],
,Psyco, is a ,just-in-time, ,specialising, compiler that integrates with CPython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. The emitted code is specialised for certain ,data types, and is faster than standard Python code.,
,In 2005, ,Nokia, released a Python interpreter for the ,Series 60, mobile phones named ,PyS60,. It includes many of the modules from the CPython implementations and some additional modules to integrate with the ,Symbian, operating system. The project has been kept up-to-date to run on all variants of the S60 platform, and several third-party modules are available. The Nokia ,N900, also supports Python with ,GTK, widget libraries, enabling programs to be written and run on the target device.,[106],
,
,Cross-compilers to other languages,[,edit,],
,There are several compilers to high-level ,object languages,, with either unrestricted Python, a restricted subset of Python, or a language similar to Python as the source language:
,
,Jython, compiles into Java byte code, which can then be executed by every ,Java virtual machine, implementation. This also enables the use of Java class library functions from the Python program.,
,IronPython, follows a similar approach in order to run Python programs on the .NET ,Common Language Runtime,.,
,The ,RPython, language can be compiled to ,C,, ,Java bytecode,, or ,Common Intermediate Language,, and is used to build the PyPy interpreter of Python.,
,Pyjs, compiles Python to ,JavaScript,.,
,Cython, compiles Python to ,C, and ,C++,.,
,Pythran compiles Python to ,C++,.,
,Somewhat dated ,Pyrex, (latest release in 2010) and ,Shed Skin, (latest release in 2013) compile to C and C++ respectively.,
,Google's Grumpy compiles Python to ,Go,.,
,MyHDL, compiles Python to ,VHDL,.,
,Nuitka, compiles Python into C++.,[107],
,Performance,[,edit,],
,A performance comparison of various Python implementations on a non-numerical (combinatorial) workload was presented at EuroSciPy '13.,[108],
,
,Development,[,edit,],
,Python's development is conducted largely through the ,Python Enhancement Proposal, (PEP) process, the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues and documenting Python design decisions.,[109], Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented on by the Python community and Guido Van Rossum, Python's ,Benevolent Dictator For Life,.,[109],
,Enhancement of the language corresponds with development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for the language's development. Specific issues are discussed in the ,Roundup, ,bug tracker, maintained at python.org.,[110], Development originally took place on a ,self-hosted, source-code repository running ,Mercurial,, until Python moved to ,GitHub, in January 2017.,[111],
,CPython's public releases come in three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented:
,
,Backward-incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and need to be manually ,ported,. The first part of the version number is incremented. These releases happen infrequently—for example, version 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0.,
,Major or ""feature"" releases, about every 18 months, are largely compatible but introduce new features. The second part of the version number is incremented. Each major version is supported by bugfixes for several years after its release.,[112],
,Bugfix releases, which introduce no new features, occur about every 3 months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. The third and final part of the version number is incremented.,[113],
,Many ,alpha, beta, and release-candidates, are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. Although there is a rough schedule for each release, they are often delayed if the code is not ready. Python's development team monitors the state of the code by running the large ,unit test, suite during development, and using the ,BuildBot, ,continuous integration, system.,[114],
,The community of Python developers has also contributed over 86,000,[115], software modules (as of  20 August 2016,[update],) to the ,Python Package Index, (PyPI), the official repository of third-party Python libraries.
,The major ,academic conference, on Python is ,PyCon,. There are also special Python mentoring programmes, such as ,Pyladies,.
,
,Naming,[,edit,],
,Python's name is derived from the British comedy group ,Monty Python,, whom Python creator Guido van Rossum enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references appear frequently in Python code and culture;,[116], for example, the ,metasyntactic variables, often used in Python literature are ,spam, and ,eggs, instead of the traditional ,foo, and ,bar,.,[116],[117], The official Python documentation also contains various references to Monty Python routines.,[118],[119],
,The prefix ,Py-, is used to show that something is related to Python. Examples of the use of this prefix in names of Python applications or libraries include ,Pygame,, a ,binding, of ,SDL, to Python (commonly used to create games); ,PyQt, and ,PyGTK,, which bind ,Qt, and ,GTK, to Python respectively; and ,PyPy,, a Python implementation originally written in Python.

,Uses,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,List of Python software,
,Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the ,TIOBE Programming Community Index, where, as of  January 2018,[update],, it is the fourth most popular language (behind ,Java,, ,C,, and ,C++,).,[120], It was selected Programming Language of the Year in 2007 and 2010.,[121],
,An empirical study found that scripting languages, such as Python, are more productive than conventional languages, such as C and Java, for programming problems involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary, and determined that memory consumption was often ""better than Java and not much worse than C or C++"".,[122],
,Large organizations that use Python include ,Wikipedia,, ,Google,,,[123], ,Yahoo!,,,[124], ,CERN,,,[125], ,NASA,,,[126], ,Facebook,,,[127], ,Amazon,, ,Instagram,, ,Spotify,[128], and some smaller entities like ,ILM,[129], and ,ITA,.,[130], The social news networking site ,Reddit, is written entirely in Python.
,Python can serve as a ,scripting language, for ,web applications,, e.g., via ,mod_wsgi, for the ,Apache web server,.,[131], With ,Web Server Gateway Interface,, a standard API has evolved to facilitate these applications. ,Web frameworks, like ,Django,, ,Pylons,, ,Pyramid,, ,TurboGears,, ,web2py,, ,Tornado,, ,Flask,, ,Bottle, and ,Zope, support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications. ,Pyjs, and ,IronPython, can be used to develop the client-side of Ajax-based applications. ,SQLAlchemy, can be used as ,data mapper, to a relational database. ,Twisted, is a framework to program communications between computers, and is used (for example) by ,Dropbox,.
,Libraries such as ,NumPy,, ,SciPy, and ,Matplotlib, allow the effective use of Python in scientific computing,,[132],[133], with specialized libraries such as ,Biopython, and ,Astropy, providing domain-specific functionality. ,SageMath, is a ,mathematical software, with a ,notebook interface, programmable in Python: its library covers many aspects of ,mathematics,, including ,algebra,, ,combinatorics,, ,numerical mathematics,, ,number theory,, and ,calculus,.
,Python has been successfully embedded in many software products as a scripting language, including in ,finite element method, software such as ,Abaqus,, 3D parametric modeler like ,FreeCAD,, 3D animation packages such as ,3ds Max,, ,Blender,, ,Cinema 4D,, ,Lightwave,, ,Houdini,, ,Maya,, ,modo,, ,MotionBuilder,, ,Softimage,, the visual effects compositor ,Nuke,, 2D imaging programs like ,GIMP,,,[134], ,Inkscape,, ,Scribus, and ,Paint Shop Pro,,,[135], and ,musical notation, programs like ,scorewriter, and ,capella,. ,GNU Debugger, uses Python as a ,pretty printer, to show complex structures such as C++ containers. ,Esri, promotes Python as the best choice for writing scripts in ,ArcGIS,.,[136], It has also been used in several video games,,[137],[138], and has been adopted as first of the three available ,programming languages, in ,Google App Engine,, the other two being ,Java, and ,Go,.,[139], Python is also used in ,algorithmic trading, and quantitative finance.,[140], Python can also be implemented in APIs of online brokerages that run on other languages by using wrappers.,[141],
,Python is commonly used in ,artificial intelligence, projects with the help of libraries like ,TensorFlow,, ,Keras, and ,Scikit-learn,.,[142],[143],[144],[145], As a scripting language with ,modular architecture,, simple syntax and rich text processing tools, Python is often used for ,natural language processing,.,[146],
,Many operating systems include Python as a standard component. It ships with most ,Linux distributions,, ,AmigaOS 4,, ,FreeBSD,, ,NetBSD,, ,OpenBSD, and ,macOS,, and can be used from the command line (terminal). Many Linux distributions use installers written in Python: ,Ubuntu, uses the ,Ubiquity, installer, while ,Red Hat Linux, and ,Fedora, use the ,Anaconda, installer. ,Gentoo Linux, uses Python in its ,package management system,, ,Portage,.
,Python is used extensively in the ,information security, industry, including in exploit development.,[147],[148],
,Most of the ,Sugar, software for the ,One Laptop per Child, XO, now developed at ,Sugar Labs,, is written in Python.,[149], The ,Raspberry Pi, ,single-board computer, project has adopted Python as its main user-programming language.
,LibreOffice, includes Python, and intends to replace Java with Python. Its Python Scripting Provider is a core feature,[150], since Version 4.0 from 7 February 2013.
,
,Languages influenced by Python,[,edit,],
,Python's design and philosophy have influenced many other programming languages:

,Boo, uses indentation, a similar syntax, and a similar object model.,[151],
,Cobra, uses indentation and a similar syntax, and its ""Acknowledgements"" document lists Python first among languages that influenced it.,[152], However, Cobra directly supports ,design-by-contract,, ,unit tests,, and optional ,static typing,.,[153],
,CoffeeScript,, a programming language that cross-compiles to JavaScript, has Python-inspired syntax.,
,ECMAScript, borrowed ,iterators, and ,generators, from Python.,[154],
,Go, is designed for the ""speed of working in a dynamic language like Python"",[155], and shares the same syntax for slicing arrays.,
,Groovy, was motivated by the desire to bring the Python design philosophy to ,Java,.,[156],
,Julia, was designed ""with ,true macros, [.. and to be] as usable for general programming as Python [and] should be as fast as C"".,[22], Calling to or from Julia is possible; to with PyCall.jl and a Python package pyjulia allows calling, in the other direction, from Python.,
,Kotlin, is a functional programming language with an interactive shell similar to Python. However, Kotlin is strongly typed with access to standard Java libraries.,[157],
,Ruby,'s creator, ,Yukihiro Matsumoto,, has said: ""I wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than Perl, and more object-oriented than Python. That's why I decided to design my own language."",[158],
,Swift,, a programming language developed by Apple, has some Python-inspired syntax.,[159],
,GDScript,, dynamically typed programming language used to create video-games. It is extremely similar to Python with a few minor differences.,
,Python's development practices have also been emulated by other languages. For example, the practice of requiring a document describing the rationale for, and issues surrounding, a change to the language (in Python, a PEP) is also used in ,Tcl,[160], and ,Erlang,.,[161],
,Python received TIOBE's Programming Language of the Year awards in 2007 and 2010. The award is given to the language with the greatest growth in popularity over the year, as measured by the ,TIOBE index,.,[162],

,ReiserFS, is a general-purpose, ,journaled computer file system, formerly designed and implemented by a team at ,Namesys, led by ,Hans Reiser,. ReiserFS is currently supported on ,Linux, (without quota support) licensed as ,GPLv2,. Introduced in version 2.4.1 of the ,Linux kernel,, it was the first journaling file system to be included in the standard kernel. ReiserFS is the default file system on the ,Elive,, ,Xandros,, ,Linspire,, and ,YOPER, ,Linux distributions,.  ReiserFS was the default file system in ,Novell,'s SUSE Linux Enterprise until Novell decided to move to ,ext3, on October 12, 2006 for future releases.,[3],
,Namesys considered ReiserFS (now occasionally referred to as Reiser3) stable and feature-complete and, with the exception of security updates and critical bug fixes, ceased development on it to concentrate on its successor, ,Reiser4,. Namesys went out of business in 2008 after Hans Reiser was convicted and sentenced to fifteen years to life in prison for the murder of his wife, Nina Reiser. Nevertheless, volunteers continue to work on the open source project.,[4],

,Features,[,edit,],
,At the time of its introduction, ReiserFS offered features that had not been available in existing Linux file systems:
,
,Metadata,-only ,journaling, (also block journaling, since Linux 2.6.8), its most-publicized advantage over what was the stock Linux file system at the time, ,ext2,.,[,citation needed,],
,Online resizing (growth only), with or without an underlying volume manager such as ,LVM,.,[,citation needed,], Since then, Namesys has also provided tools to resize (both grow and shrink) ReiserFS file systems offline.,[,citation needed,],
,Tail packing,, a scheme to reduce ,internal fragmentation,. Tail packing, however, can have a significant performance impact. Reiser4 may have improved this by packing tails where it does not negatively affect performance.,[5],
,Performance,[,edit,],
,Compared with ,ext2, and ,ext3, in version 2.4 of the Linux kernel, when dealing with files under 4 ,KiB, and with tail packing enabled, ReiserFS may,[6], be faster.  This was said,[,by whom?,], to be of great benefit in ,Usenet, news spools, HTTP caches, mail delivery systems, and other applications where performance with small files is critical.  However, in practice,[,according to whom?,], news spools use a feature called cycbuf, which holds articles in one large file; fast HTTP caches and several ,revision control, systems use a similar approach, nullifying these performance advantages. For email servers, ReiserFS was problematic due to semantic problems explained below.  Also, ReiserFS had a problem with very fast filesystem aging when compared to other filesystems — in several usage scenarios filesystem performance decreased dramatically with time.,[,citation needed,],
,Before Linux 2.6.33,,[7], ReiserFS heavily used the ,big kernel lock, (BKL) — a global kernel-wide lock — which does not scale very well,[8],[9], for systems with multiple cores, as the critical code parts are only ever executed by one core at a time.
,
,History,[,edit,],
,Default file system in SuSE Linux/openSUSE,[,edit,],
,ReiserFS was the default file system in SuSE Linux since version 6.4 (released in 2000),,[10],[11], until switching to ,ext3, in ,SUSE Linux Enterprise, 10.2/,openSUSE, 11, announced in 2006.,[12],[13],
,Jeff Mahoney of SUSE wrote a post on 14 September 2006 proposing to move from ReiserFS to ,ext3, for the default installation file system.,[8], Some reasons he mentioned were scalability, ""performance problems with ,extended attributes, and ,ACLs,"", ""a small and shrinking development community"", and that "",Reiser4, is not an incremental update and requires a reformat, which is unreasonable for most people."",[8], On October 4 he wrote a response comment on a blog in order to clear up some issues.,[14], He wrote that his proposal for the switch was unrelated to Hans Reiser being under trial for murder.,[15], Mahoney wrote he ""was concerned that people would make a connection where none existed"" and that ""the timing is entirely coincidental and the motivation is unrelated."",[14],
,
,Criticism,[,edit,],
,Some directory operations (including ,unlink,(2)) are not ,synchronous, on ReiserFS, which can result in data corruption with applications relying heavily on file-based locks (such as ,mail transfer agents, ,qmail,[16], and ,Postfix,[17],)  if the machine halts before it has synchronized the disk.,[18],
,There are no programs to specifically ,defragment, a ReiserFS file system, although tools have been written to automatically copy the contents of fragmented files hoping that more contiguous blocks of free space can be found. However, a ""repacker"" tool was planned for the next Reiser4 file system to deal with file fragmentation.,[19],
,
,fsck,[,edit,],
,The tree rebuild process of ReiserFS's ,fsck, has attracted much criticism by the *nix community: If the file system becomes so badly corrupted that its internal tree is unusable, performing a tree rebuild operation may further corrupt existing files or introduce new entries with unexpected contents,,[20], but this action is not part of normal operation or a normal file system check and has to be explicitly initiated and confirmed by the administrator.
,ReiserFS v3 images should not be stored on a ReiserFS v3 ,partition, (e.g., backups or ,disk images, for emulators) without transforming them (e.g., by compressing or encrypting) in order to avoid confusing the rebuild. Reformatting an existing ReiserFS v3 partition can also leave behind data that could confuse the rebuild operation and make files from the old system reappear. This also allows malicious users to intentionally store files that will confuse the rebuilder. As the metadata is always in a consistent state after a file system check, ,corruption, here means that contents of files are merged in unexpected ways with the contained file system's metadata. The ReiserFS successor, Reiser4, fixes this problem.
,
,Earlier issues,[,edit,],
,ReiserFS in versions of the Linux kernel before 2.4.16 were considered unstable by Namesys and not recommended for production use, especially in conjunction with ,NFS,.,[21],
,Early implementations of ReiserFS (prior to that in Linux 2.6.2) were also susceptible to out-of-order write hazards. But the current journaling implementation in ReiserFS is now on par with that of ,ext3,'s ""ordered"" journaling level.
,
,Design,[,edit,],
,ReiserFS stores file metadata (""stat items""), ,directory, entries (""directory items""), ,inode, block lists (""indirect items""), and tails of ,files, (""direct items"") in a single, combined ,B+ tree, keyed by a universal object ID. Disk blocks allocated to nodes of the tree are ""formatted internal blocks"".  Blocks for leaf nodes (in which items are packed end-to-end) are ""formatted leaf blocks"".  All other blocks are ""unformatted blocks"" containing file contents.  Directory items with too many entries or indirect items which are too long to fit into a node spill over into the right leaf neighbour. Block allocation is tracked by ,free space bitmaps, in fixed locations.
,By contrast, ,ext2, and other Berkeley ,FFS,-like file systems of that time simply used a fixed formula for computing inode locations, hence limiting the number of files they may contain.,[22], Most such file systems also store directories as simple lists of entries, which makes directory lookups and updates ,linear time, operations and degrades performance on very large directories. The single ,B+ tree, design in ReiserFS avoids both of these problems due to better scalability properties.

,Website,docs,.microsoft,.com,/en-US,/windows-server,/storage,/refs,/refs-overview,
,Resilient File System, (,ReFS,),,[5], codenamed ""Protogon"",,[6], is a ,Microsoft, ,proprietary, ,file system, introduced with ,Windows Server 2012, with the intent of becoming the ""next generation"" ,file system, after ,NTFS,.
,ReFS was designed to overcome problems that had become significant over the years since NTFS was conceived, which are related to how data storage requirements had changed. The key design advantages of ReFS include automatic ,integrity checking, and ,data scrubbing,, removal of the need for running ,chkdsk,, protection against ,data degradation,, built-in handling of ,hard disk drive failure, and ,redundancy,, integration of ,RAID, functionality, a switch to ,copy/allocate on write, for data and metadata updates, handling of ,very long paths and filenames,, and ,storage virtualization, and pooling, including almost arbitrarily sized ,logical volumes, (unrelated to the physical sizes of the used drives).
,These requirements arose from two major changes in storage systems and usage — the size of storage in use (large or massive arrays of multi-terabyte drives now being fairly common), and the need for ,continual reliability,. As a result, the file system needs to be self-repairing (to prevent disk checking from being impractically slow or disruptive), along with ,abstraction, or virtualization between physical disks and logical volumes.
,ReFS was initially added to ,Windows Server 2012, only, with the aim of gradual migration to consumer systems in future versions; this was achieved as of ,Windows 8.1,.,[7], The initial versions removed some NTFS features, such as ,disk quotas,, ,alternate data streams,, and ,extended attributes,. Some of these were re-implemented in later versions of ReFS.
,In early versions (2012–2013), ReFS was similar to or slightly faster than NTFS in most tests,,[8], but far slower when full integrity checking was enabled, a result attributed to the relative newness of ReFS.,[9],[10], Pre-release concerns were also voiced by one blogger,[,who?,], over ,Storage Spaces,, the storage system designed to underpin ReFS, which reportedly could fail in a manner that prevented ReFS from recovering automatically.,[11],[12],[13],
,The ability to create ReFS volumes was removed in Windows 10's 2017 Fall Creators Update for all editions except Enterprise and Pro for Workstations,,[4], which would seem to indicate Microsoft is no longer intending ReFS as a general replacement for NTFS, at least in the near future.

,Feature changes compared to NTFS,[,edit,],
,Major new features,[,edit,],
,Improved reliability for on-disk structures,
,ReFS uses ,B+ trees, for all on-disk structures, including all metadata and file data.,[2],[15],  Metadata and file data are organized into tables similar to a ,relational database,. The file size, number of files in a ,folder,, total volume size and number of folders in a volume are limited by 64-bit numbers; as a result, ReFS supports a maximum file size of 16 ,exbibytes, (2,64,−1 bytes), a maximum of 18.4 × 10,18, directories and a maximum volume size of 1 ,yobibyte, (2,80, bytes) (with 64 ,KiB, ,clusters,) which allows large scalability with no practical limits on file and directory size (hardware limits still apply). Free space is counted by a hierarchical allocator which includes three separate tables for large, medium, and small chunks.,
,Built-in resilience,
,ReFS employs an ,allocation-on-write, update strategy for metadata,,[2],  which allocates new chunks for every update transaction and uses large ,IO, batches. All ReFS metadata have 64-bit checksums which are stored independently. The file data can have an optional checksum in a separate ""integrity ,stream,"", in which case the file update strategy also implements allocation-on-write for file data; this is controlled by a new ""integrity"" attribute applicable to both files and directories. If file data or metadata become corrupt, the file can be deleted without taking the whole volume offline for maintenance, and then be restored from the backup. As a result of built-in resiliency, administrators do not need to periodically run error-checking tools such as ,CHKDSK, when using ReFS.,
,Compatibility with existing APIs and technologies,
,ReFS supports only a subset of NTFS features, and only Win32 APIs that are ""widely adopted""; but does not require new system APIs and most file system filters continue to work with ReFS volumes.,[2],  ReFS supports many existing Windows and NTFS features such as ,BitLocker, encryption, ,Access Control Lists,, ,USN Journal,, change notifications,,[16], ,symbolic links,, ,junction points,, ,mount points,, ,reparse points,, ,volume snapshots,, ,file IDs,, and ,oplock,. ReFS seamlessly integrates with ,Storage Spaces,,,[2], a ,storage virtualization, layer that allows data mirroring and striping, as well as sharing storage pools between machines.,[17], ReFS resiliency features enhance the mirroring feature provided by Storage Spaces and can detect whether any mirrored copies of files become corrupt using a ,data scrubbing, process,,[15], which periodically reads all mirror copies and verifies their checksums, then replaces bad copies with good ones.,
,Removed features,[,edit,],
,Some NTFS features are not implemented in ReFS. These include ,object IDs,, ,8.3 filename,, ,NTFS compression,, ,Encrypting File System, (EFS), ,transactional NTFS,, ,hard links,, ,extended attributes,, and ,disk quotas,.,[6],[2],[18], In addition, Windows cannot be booted from a ReFS volume.,[2], Dynamic disks with mirrored or striped volumes are replaced with mirrored or striped storage pools provided by Storage Spaces; however, automated error-correction is only supported on mirrored spaces. ,Data deduplication, was missing in early versions of ReFS.,[2],, it was implemented in v3.2, debuting in Windows Server v1709.,[3],
,Support for ,alternate data streams, was initially not implemented in ReFS.  In Windows 8.1 64-bit and Server 2012 R2 the file system reacquired support for alternate data streams, with lengths of up to 128K, and automatic correction of corruption when integrity streams are used on parity spaces.,[19], ReFS had initially been unsuitable for ,Microsoft SQL Server, instance allocation due to the absence of alternate data streams.,[20],
,As of March 2015, a review of the state of ReFS on ,WIndowsNetworking.com, stated:
,
,
,You can’t (at least at this time) boot Windows from an ReFS volume and the first versions of ReFS don’t include file-level compression and encryption, disk quotas or hard links, all of which are advantages of NTFS over the FAT file systems. Note that ReFS does support sparse files, reparse points, case-sensitive file names and Unicode in file names and perhaps most important, it preserves and enforces access control lists (ACLs).
,It’s obvious that ReFS in its current iteration is not a replacement for NTFS ... because some applications that rely on specific NTFS features might not work with ReFS [... however...] Storage of most conventional data doesn’t require the specific NTFS features that aren’t supported by ReFS and so ReFS can handle that duty nicely. Its primary use case is on file servers that store extremely large amounts of data. It has data integrity and recovery mechanisms built into the file system, as well. That means those tools that are designed to detect and repair file corruption in other file systems aren’t necessary, so their incompatibility with ReFS isn’t really an issue. Additionally, although ReFS doesn’t support file level (Encrypting File System) encryption, BitLocker can be used to protect ReFS volumes so that’s not so much of an issue, either [...]
,ReFS has some distinct advantages over current reigning Windows file system NTFS, but it also has some drawbacks. It boasts self-healing powers, ability to repair files without down time, less risk that data will be lost when there’s a power failure (due to the way it writes metadata), and of course the ability to create huge volumes and files and even give those files names that are longer than 255 characters if you wish. But it’s not quite ready for prime time yet.,[21],

,Version history and compatibility,[,edit,],
,This article ,may be ,confusing or unclear, to readers,., Please help us ,clarify the article,. There might be a discussion about this on ,the talk page,.,  ,(July 2017), (,Learn how and when to remove this template message,),
,ReFS has some different versions, with various degrees of compatibility between operating system versions. Aside for development versions of the filesystem, usually later operating system versions can mount filesystems created with earlier OS versions (backwards compatibility). Some features may not be compatible with the feature set of the OS. The version, cluster size and other features of the filesystem can be queried with the command ,fsutil fsinfo refsinfo volumename,.

,Notes:
,
,1,: The following message is recorded to the event log: 'Volume ""?:"" was mounted in an older version of Windows. Some features may be lost.',
,2,: Windows upgrades it to 3.1 when the volume is mounted with write access.,
,3,: Windows upgrades it to 3.2 when the volume is mounted with write access.,
,4,: Windows upgrades it to 3.3 when the volume is mounted with write access.,
,5,: ReFS volume creation ability removed in Windows 10 v1709 (2017's Fall Creators Update), except for Enterprise and Pro for Workstations editions.,
,Stability and known problems,[,edit,],
,Issues identified or suggested for ReFS, when running on Storage Spaces (its intended design,[13],), include:
,
,Adding thin-provisioned ReFS on top of Storage Spaces (according to a 2012 pre-release article) can fail in a non-graceful manner, in which the volume without warning becomes inaccessible or unmanageable.,[11], This can happen, for example, if the physical disks underlying a storage space became too full. ,Smallnetbuilder, comments that, in such cases, recovery could be ""prohibitive"" as a ""breakthrough in theory"" is needed to identify storage space layouts and recover them, which is required before any ReFS recovery of file system contents can be started; therefore it recommends using backups as well.,[11],
,Even when Storage Spaces is not thinly provisioned, ReFS may still be unable to dependably correct all file errors in some situations, because Storage Spaces operates on blocks and not files, and therefore some files may potentially lack necessary blocks or recovery data if part of the storage space is not working correctly. As a result, disk and data addition and removal may be impaired, and redundancy conversion becomes difficult or impossible.,[12],
,There are no tools to repair or recover a ReFS filesystem. Third party tools are dependent on ,reverse engineering, the system and (as of 2014) few of these exist.,[13],[23],
,Windows Store, cannot install apps on a ReFS volume.,[24],
,Server 2016 updates,[,edit,],
,At the ,Storage Developer Conference, 2015, a Microsoft developer presented enhancements of ReFS expected to be released with ,Windows Server 2016, and included in Technical Preview 4, titled ""ReFS v2"".,[25], It highlighted that ReFS now included capabilities for very high speed moving, reordering, and cloning of blocks between files,[26], (which can be done for all blocks of a file). This is particularly needed for ,virtualization,, and is stated to allow fast provisioning, diff merging, and tiering. Other enhancements cover the redo log (for synchronous disk writes), ,parallelization,, efficient tracking of uninitialized sparse data and files, and efficient 4k ,I/O,.,[25], ReFS with File Integrity enabled also acts more like a ,log-structured file system,, coalescing small random writes into large sequential ones for efficiency.,[27],[,dubious, , – ,discuss,],
,
,Performance and competitor comparisons,[,edit,],
,Other operating systems have competing file systems to ReFS, of which the best known are ,ZFS, and ,Btrfs,, in the sense that all three are designed to integrate data protection, snapshots, and silent high speed background healing of corruption and data errors.
,In 2012, ,Phoronix, wrote an analysis,[28], of ReFS vs ,Btrfs,, a ,copy-on-write, file system for ,Linux,. Their features are similar, with both supporting checksums, ,RAID,-like use of multiple disks, and error detection/correction. However, ReFS lacks copy-on-write snapshots and compression, both found in Btrfs and ZFS.
,In 2014, a review of ReFS and assessment of its readiness for production use concluded that ReFS had at least some advantages over two of its main ,file system, competitors.
,
,ZFS, (used in ,Solaris,, ,illumos,, ,FreeBSD, and others) was widely criticized for its comparatively extreme memory requirements of many gigabytes of ,RAM, for online deduplication. However, online deduplication is never enabled by default in ZFS and is not supported by ReFS, so not enabling ZFS online deduplication yields a more even comparison between the two file systems as ZFS then has a memory requirement of only a few hundred megabytes.,[29],
,Offerings such as ,Drobo, used ,proprietary, methods which have no fallback if the company behind them fails.,[30],

,QNX4FS, is an extent-based ,file system, used by the ,QNX4, and QNX6 operating systems.
,As the file system uses ,soft updates,, it remains consistent even after a ,power failure,, without using ,journaling,. Instead, the writes are carefully ordered and flushed to ,disk, at appropriate intervals so that the on-disk structure always remains consistent, no matter if the operation is interrupted. However, unflushed changes to the file system  are nevertheless lost, as the ,disk cache, is typically stored in ,volatile memory,. This design has a considerable performance gain over journaling, by just bypassing that step.,[,citation needed,],
,Another notable property of this file system is that its actual metadata, like ,inode, information and disk bitmaps, are accessible in the same way as any other file on the file system (as ,/.inodes, and ,/.bitmap,, respectively). This is consistent with QNX's (in fact, ,Plan 9 from Bell Labs,'s, or historically ,Unix,'s) philosophy that "",everything is a file,"".

,Features,[,edit,],
,QFS supports some volume management capabilities, allowing many disks to be grouped together into a file system.  File system metadata can be kept on a separate set of disks, which is useful for streaming applications where long disk seeks cannot be tolerated.
,SAM extends the QFS file system transparently to archival storage. A SAM-QFS file system may have a relatively small (gigabytes to terabytes) ""disk cache"" backed by petabytes of tape or other bulk storage. Files are copied to archival storage in the background, and transparently retrieved to disk when accessed. SAM-QFS supports up to four archival copies, each of which can be on disk, tape, optical media, or may be stored at a remote site also running SAM-QFS.
,Shared QFS adds a multi-writer global filesystem, allowing multiple machines to read from & write to the same disks concurrently through the use of multi-ported disks or a ,storage area network,. (QFS also has a single-writer/multi-reader mode which can be used to share disks between hosts without the need for a network connection.)
,
,History,[,edit,],
,SAM-QFS, originally developed by LSC Inc, was purchased by Sun in 2001. Sun released the SAM-QFS source code to the ,OpenSolaris, project in March 2008.,[3], After Sun's acquisition, Oracle continues to develop the SAM-QFS product. Later Oracle renamed SAM-QFS into Oracle HSM (Oracle Hierarchical Storage Manager).,[4],

,Computer programming, is the process of designing and building an ,executable, ,computer program, for accomplishing a specific ,computing, task. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating ,algorithms,, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen ,programming language, (commonly referred to as ,coding,[1],[2],). The ,source code, of a program is written in one or more programming languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task for solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the ,application domain,, specialized algorithms, and formal ,logic,.
,Related programming tasks include ,testing,, ,debugging,, maintaining a program's ,source code,, implementation of ,build systems,, and management of derived artifacts such as ,machine code, of computer programs. These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term ,software development, is used for this larger process with the term ,programming,, ,implementation,, or ,coding, reserved for the actual writing of source code. ,Software engineering, combines ,engineering, techniques with software development practices.

,History,[,edit,],
,  ,Ada Lovelace,, whose notes added to the end of ,Luigi Menabrea,'s paper included the first ,algorithm, designed for processing by an ,Analytical Engine,. She is often recognized as history's first computer programmer.,
,See also: ,History of programming languages,
,Programmable devices have existed at least as far back as 1206 AD, when the ,automata, of ,Al-Jazari, were programmable, via pegs and ,cams,, to play various rhythms and drum patterns;,[3], and the 1801 ,Jacquard loom, could produce entirely different weaves by changing the ""program"" - a series of ,pasteboard, cards with holes punched in them.
,However, the first computer program is generally dated to 1843, when mathematician ,Ada Lovelace, published an ,algorithm, to calculate a sequence of ,Bernoulli numbers,, intended to be carried out by ,Charles Babbage,'s ,Analytical Engine,.,[4], Women would continue to dominate the field of computer programming until the mid 1960s.,[5],
,
,  ,Data and instructions were once stored on external ,punched cards,, which were kept in order and arranged in program decks.,
,In the 1880s ,Herman Hollerith, invented the concept of storing ,data, in machine-readable form.,[6], Later a ,control panel, (plugboard) added to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for different jobs, and by the late 1940s, ,unit record equipment, such as the ,IBM 602, and ,IBM 604,, were programmed by control panels in a similar way; as were the first ,electronic computers,. However, with the concept of the ,stored-program computers, introduced in 1949, both programs and data were stored and manipulated in the same way in ,computer memory,.,[,citation needed,],
,Machine code, was the language of early programs, written in the ,instruction set, of the particular machine, often in ,binary, notation. ,Assembly languages, were soon developed that let the programmer specify instruction in a text format, (e.g., ADD X, TOTAL), with abbreviations for each operation code and meaningful names for specifying addresses. However, because an assembly language is little more than a different notation for a machine language, any two machines with ,different instruction sets, also have different assembly languages. ,Kathleen Booth, created one of the first Assembly languages in 1950 for various computers at ,Birkbeck College,.,[7],
,
,  ,Wired control panel for an ,IBM 402 Accounting Machine,.,
,High-level languages, allow the programmer to write programs in terms that are syntactically richer, and more capable of ,abstracting, the code, making it targetable to varying machine instruction sets via compilation declarations and heuristics. The first ,compiler, for a programming language was developed by ,Grace Hopper,.,[8], When Hopper went to work on ,UNIVAC, in 1949, she brought the idea of using compilers with her.,[9],[10], Compilers harness the power of computers to make programming easier,[11], by allowing programmers to specify calculations by entering a formula using ,infix notation, (e.g., ,Y = X*2 + 5*X + 9,) for example. ,FORTRAN,, the first widely used high-level language to have a functional implementation which permitted the abstraction of reusable blocks of code, came out in 1957.,[12], In 1951 ,Frances E. Holberton, developed the first ,sort-merge generator, which ran on the ,UNIVAC I,.,[13], Another woman working at UNIVAC, ,Adele Mildred Koss,, developed a program that was a precursor to ,report generators,.,[13], In Russia, ,Kateryna Yushchenko, developed the ,Address programming language, for the ,MESM, in 1955.,[14],
,The idea for the creation of COBOL started in 1959 when ,Mary K. Hawes,, who worked for ,Burroghs Corporation,, set up a meeting to discuss creating a common business language.,[15], She invited six people, including Grace Hopper.,[15], Hopper was involved in developing COBOL as a business language and creating ""self-documenting"" programming.,[16],[17], Hopper's contribution to COBOL was based on her programming language, called ,FLOW-MATIC,.,[10],  In 1961, ,Jean E. Sammet, developed ,FORMAC, and also published ,Programming Languages: History and Fundamentals, which went on to be a standard work on programming languages.,[15],[18],
,Programs were mostly still entered using punched cards or ,paper tape,. See ,computer programming in the punch card era,. By the late 1960s, ,data storage devices, and ,computer terminals, became inexpensive enough that programs could be created by typing directly into the computers. Frances Holberton created a code to allow keyboard inputs while she worked at UNIVAC.,[19], ,Text editors, were developed that allowed changes and corrections to be made much more easily than with punched cards. ,Sister Mary Kenneth Keller, worked on developing the programming language, ,BASIC, which she was a graduate student at Dartmouth in the 1960s.,[20], One of the first ,object-oriented programming, languages, ,Smalltalk,, was developed by seven programmers, including ,Adele Goldberg,, in the 1970s.,[21], In 1985, ,Radia Perlman, developed the ,Spinning Tree Protocol, in order to route packets of network information efficiently.,[22],[23],

,Whatever the approach to development may be, the final program must satisfy some fundamental properties. The following properties are among the most important:
,
,Reliability,: how often the results of a program are correct. This depends on conceptual correctness of algorithms, and minimization of programming mistakes, such as mistakes in resource management (e.g., ,buffer overflows, and ,race conditions,) and logic errors (such as division by zero or ,off-by-one errors,).,
,Robustness,: how well a program anticipates problems due to errors (not bugs). This includes situations such as incorrect, inappropriate or corrupt data, unavailability of needed resources such as memory, operating system services and network connections, user error, and unexpected power outages.,
,Usability,: the ,ergonomics, of a program: the ease with which a person can use the program for its intended purpose or in some cases even unanticipated purposes. Such issues can make or break its success even regardless of other issues. This involves a wide range of textual, graphical and sometimes hardware elements that improve the clarity, intuitiveness, cohesiveness and completeness of a program's user interface.,
,Portability,: the range of ,computer hardware, and ,operating system, platforms on which the source code of a program can be ,compiled,/,interpreted, and run. This depends on differences in the programming facilities provided by the different platforms, including hardware and operating system resources, expected behavior of the hardware and operating system, and availability of platform specific compilers (and sometimes libraries) for the language of the source code.,
,Maintainability,: the ease with which a program can be modified by its present or future developers in order to make improvements or customizations, fix ,bugs, and ,security holes,, or adapt it to new environments. Good practices,[24], during initial development make the difference in this regard. This quality may not be directly apparent to the end user but it can significantly affect the fate of a program over the long term.,
,Efficiency,/,performance,: Measure of system resources a program consumes (processor time, memory space, slow devices such as disks, network bandwidth and to some extent even user interaction): the less, the better. This also includes careful management of resources, for example cleaning up ,temporary files, and eliminating ,memory leaks,.,
,Readability of source code,[,edit,],
,In computer programming, ,readability, refers to the ease with which a human reader can comprehend the purpose, ,control flow,, and operation of source code. It affects the aspects of quality above, including portability, usability and most importantly maintainability.
,Readability is important because programmers spend the majority of their time reading, trying to understand and modifying existing source code, rather than writing new source code. Unreadable code often leads to bugs, inefficiencies, and ,duplicated code,. A study,[25], found that a few simple readability transformations made code shorter and drastically reduced the time to understand it.
,Following a consistent ,programming style, often helps readability. However, readability is more than just programming style. Many factors, having little or nothing to do with the ability of the computer to efficiently compile and execute the code, contribute to readability.,[26], Some of these factors include:
,
,Different ,indent styles, (whitespace),
,Comments,
,Decomposition,
,Naming conventions, for objects (such as variables, classes, procedures, etc.),
,The ,presentation, aspects of this (such as indents, line breaks, color highlighting, and so on) are often handled by the ,source code editor,, but the content aspects reflect the programmer's talent and skills.
,Various ,visual programming languages, have also been developed with the intent to resolve readability concerns by adopting non-traditional approaches to code structure and display. ,Integrated development environments, (IDEs) aim to integrate all such help. Techniques like ,Code refactoring, can enhance readability.
,
,Algorithmic complexity,[,edit,],
,The academic field and the engineering practice of computer programming are both largely concerned with discovering and implementing the most efficient algorithms for a given class of problem. For this purpose, algorithms are classified into ,orders, using so-called ,Big O notation,, which expresses resource use, such as execution time or memory consumption, in terms of the size of an input. Expert programmers are familiar with a variety of well-established algorithms and their respective complexities and use this knowledge to choose algorithms that are best suited to the circumstances.
,
,Chess algorithms as an example,[,edit,],
,""Programming a Computer for Playing Chess"" was a 1950 paper that evaluated a ""minimax"" ,algorithm, that is part of the history of algorithmic complexity; a course on IBM's ,Deep Blue (chess computer), is part of the computer science curriculum at ,Stanford Univeristy,.,[27],
,
,Methodologies,[,edit,],
,The first step in most formal software development processes is requirements analysis, followed by testing to determine value modeling, implementation, and failure elimination (debugging). There exist a lot of differing approaches for each of those tasks. One approach popular for ,requirements analysis, is ,Use Case, analysis. Many programmers use forms of ,Agile software development, where the various stages of formal software development are more integrated together into short cycles that take a few weeks rather than years. There are many approaches to the Software development process.
,Popular modeling techniques include Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (,OOAD,) and Model-Driven Architecture (,MDA,). The Unified Modeling Language (,UML,) is a notation used for both the OOAD and MDA.
,A similar technique used for database design is Entity-Relationship Modeling (,ER Modeling,).
,Implementation techniques include imperative languages (,object-oriented, or ,procedural,), ,functional languages,, and ,logic languages,.
,
,Measuring language usage,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Measuring programming language popularity,
,It is very difficult to determine what are the most popular of modern programming languages. Methods of measuring programming language popularity include: counting the number of job advertisements that mention the language,,[28], the number of books sold and courses teaching the language (this overestimates the importance of newer languages), and estimates of the number of existing lines of code written in the language (this underestimates the number of users of business languages such as COBOL).
,Some languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications, while some languages are regularly used to write many different kinds of applications. For example, ,COBOL, is still strong in corporate data centers,[29], often on large ,mainframe computers,, ,Fortran, in engineering applications, ,scripting languages, in ,Web, development, and ,C, in ,embedded software,. Many applications use a mix of several languages in their construction and use.  New languages are generally designed around the syntax of a prior language with new functionality added, (for example ,C++, adds object-orientation to C, and ,Java, adds memory management and ,bytecode, to C++, but as a result, loses efficiency and the ability for low-level manipulation).
,
,Debugging,[,edit,],
,  ,The ,bug, from 1947 which is at the origin of a popular (but incorrect) etymology for the common term for a software defect.,
,Main article: ,Debugging,
,Debugging is a very important task in the software development process since having defects in a program can have significant consequences for its users. Some languages are more prone to some kinds of faults because their specification does not require compilers to perform as much checking as other languages. Use of a ,static code analysis, tool can help detect some possible problems. Normally the first step in debugging is to attempt to reproduce the problem. This can be a non-trivial task, for example as with parallel processes or some unusual software bugs. Also, specific user environment and usage history can make it difficult to reproduce the problem.
,After the bug is reproduced, the input of the program may need to be simplified to make it easier to debug. For example, a bug in a compiler can make it crash when parsing some large source file. However, after simplification of the test case, only few lines from the original source file can be sufficient to reproduce the same crash. Such simplification can be done manually, using a divide-and-conquer approach. The programmer will try to remove some parts of original test case and check if the problem still exists. When debugging the problem in a GUI, the programmer can try to skip some user interaction from the original problem description and check if remaining actions are sufficient for bugs to appear.
,Debugging is often done with ,IDEs, like ,Eclipse,, ,Visual Studio,, ,Xcode,, ,Kdevelop,, ,NetBeans, and ,Code::Blocks,. Standalone debuggers like ,GDB, are also used, and these often provide less of a visual environment, usually using a ,command line,. Some text editors such as ,Emacs, allow GDB to be invoked through them, to provide a visual environment.
,
,Programming languages,[,edit,],
,Main articles: ,Programming language, and ,List of programming languages,
,Different programming languages support different styles of programming (called ,programming paradigms,). The choice of language used is subject to many considerations, such as company policy, suitability to task, availability of third-party packages, or individual preference. Ideally, the programming language best suited for the task at hand will be selected. Trade-offs from this ideal involve finding enough programmers who know the language to build a team, the availability of compilers for that language, and the efficiency with which programs written in a given language execute. Languages form an approximate spectrum from ""low-level"" to ""high-level""; ""low-level"" languages are typically more machine-oriented and faster to execute, whereas ""high-level"" languages are more abstract and easier to use but execute less quickly. It is usually easier to code in ""high-level"" languages than in ""low-level"" ones.
,Allen Downey,, in his book ,How To Think Like A Computer Scientist,, writes:
,
,The details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language:
,Input: Gather data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device.,
,Output: Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.,
,Arithmetic: Perform basic arithmetical operations like addition and multiplication.,
,Conditional Execution: Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate sequence of statements.,
,Repetition: Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.,
,Many computer languages provide a mechanism to call functions provided by ,shared libraries,. Provided the functions in a library follow the appropriate run-time conventions (e.g., method of passing ,arguments,), then these functions may be written in any other language.

,Canada, (,Canadian French: ,[kanadɑ],) is a country located in the northern part of ,North America,. Its ,ten provinces and three territories, extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering 9.98 million square kilometres (3.85 million square miles), making it the world's ,second-largest country by total area,. Canada's southern ,border with the United States, is the world's longest bi-national land border. Its capital is ,Ottawa,, and its three ,largest metropolitan areas, are ,Toronto,, ,Montreal,, and ,Vancouver,. As a whole, Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land area being dominated by forest and tundra. Consequently, its population is highly ,urbanized,, with over 80 percent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium-sized cities, many near the southern border. ,Canada's climate, varies widely across its vast area, ranging from ,arctic weather, in the north, to hot summers in the southern regions, with four distinct seasons.
,Various ,indigenous peoples, have inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years prior to European colonization. Beginning in the 16th century, ,British, and ,French, expeditions explored, and later settled, along the Atlantic coast.  As a consequence of ,various armed conflicts,, France ceded nearly all of ,its colonies in North America, in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three ,British North American, colonies through ,Confederation,, Canada was formed as a ,federal, ,dominion, of four provinces. This began an ,accretion of provinces and territories, and a process of increasing autonomy from the ,United Kingdom,. This widening autonomy was highlighted by the ,Statute of Westminster, of 1931 and culminated in the ,Canada Act, of 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the ,British parliament,, except for the power to amend ,its constitution,.
,Canada is a ,federal, ,parliamentary democracy, and a ,constitutional monarchy,, with Queen ,Elizabeth II, being the ,head of state,. The country is a ,realm, within the ,Commonwealth of Nations,, a member of the ,Francophonie, and ,officially bilingual, at the federal level. It ,ranks among the highest, in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, and education. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and ,multicultural, nations, the product of ,large-scale immigration, from many other countries. Canada's ,long and complex relationship, with the United States has had a significant impact on its ,economy, and ,culture,.
,Canada is a ,developed country, and has the ,fifteenth-highest, nominal per capita income globally as well as the ,tenth-highest, ranking in the ,Human Development Index,. Its advanced economy is the ,tenth-largest in the world,, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada is part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the ,United Nations,, the ,North Atlantic Treaty Organization,, the ,G7, (formerly ,G8,), the ,Group of Ten,, the ,G20,, the ,North American Free Trade Agreement, and the ,Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, forum.

,Etymology,
,Main article: ,Name of Canada,
,While a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of ,Canada,, the name is now accepted as coming from the ,St. Lawrence Iroquoian, word ,kanata,, meaning ""village"" or ""settlement"".,[11], In 1535, indigenous inhabitants of the present-day ,Quebec City, region used the word to direct French explorer ,Jacques Cartier, to the village of ,Stadacona,.,[12], Cartier later used the word ,Canada, to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to ,Donnacona, (the chief at Stadacona);,[12], by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the ,Saint Lawrence River, as ,Canada,.,[12],
,From the 16th to the early 18th century "",Canada,"" referred to the part of ,New France, that lay along the Saint Lawrence River.,[13], In 1791, the area became two British colonies called ,Upper Canada, and ,Lower Canada, collectively named ,the Canadas,; until their union as the British ,Province of Canada, in 1841.,[14], Upon ,Confederation, in 1867, ,Canada, was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the London Conference, and the word ,Dominion, was conferred as the country's title.,[15], The transition away from the use of Dominion was formally reflected in 1982 with the passage of the ,Canada Act,, which refers only to ,Canada,. Later that year, the name of the national holiday was ,changed from Dominion Day to Canada Day,.,[16], The term ,Dominion, is also used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces, though after the ,Second World War, the term ,federal, had replaced ,dominion,.,[17],

,Indigenous peoples,
,  ,Linguistic areas of North American Indigenous peoples, at the time of European contact,
,Indigenous peoples in present-day Canada, include the ,First Nations,, ,Inuit,, and ,Métis,,,[18], the last being a ,mixed-blood, people who originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations and Inuit people married European settlers.,[18], The term ""Aboriginal"" as a ,collective noun, is a specific ,term of art, used in some legal documents, including the ,Constitution Act 1982,.,[19],
,The ,first inhabitants of North America, are generally hypothesized to have migrated from ,Siberia, by way of the ,Bering land bridge,[20], and arrived at least 14,000 years ago.,[21], The ,Paleo-Indian, archaeological sites at ,Old Crow Flats, and ,Bluefish Caves, are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada.,[22], The characteristics of Canadian indigenous societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks.,[23],[24], Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations.,[25],
,The ,indigenous population, at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000,[26], and two million,,[27], with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada's ,Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples,.,[28], As a consequence of European colonization, the population of Canada's indigenous peoples declined by forty to eighty percent, and several First Nations, such as the ,Beothuk,, disappeared.,[29], The decline is attributed to several causes, including the ,transfer of European diseases,, such as ,influenza,, ,measles,, and ,smallpox, to which they had no natural immunity,,[26],[30], conflicts over the fur trade, conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers, and the loss of indigenous lands to settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations' self-sufficiency.,[31],[32],
,Although not without conflict, ,European Canadians,' early interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful.,[33], First Nations and Métis peoples played a critical part in the development of ,European colonies in Canada,, particularly for their role in assisting European ,coureur des bois, and ,voyageurs, in the exploration of the continent during the ,North American fur trade,.,[34], ,The Crown and indigenous peoples, began ,interactions, during the European colonization period, though the Inuit, in general, had more limited interaction with European settlers.,[35], However, from the late 18th century, European Canadians encouraged indigenous peoples to assimilate into their own culture.,[36], These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with ,forced integration, and ,relocations,.,[37], A period of redress is underway, which started with the appointment of the ,Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, by the ,Government of Canada, in 2008.,[38],
,
,European colonization,
,The first known attempt at ,European colonization, began when ,Norsemen, settled briefly at ,L'Anse aux Meadows, in ,Newfoundland, around 1000 AD.,[39], No further European exploration occurred until 1497, when Italian seafarer ,John Cabot, explored and claimed Canada's ,Atlantic coast, in the name of King ,Henry VII of England,.,[40],[41], Then ,Basque, and ,Portuguese, mariners established seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast in the early 16th century.,[42], In 1534, French explorer ,Jacques Cartier, explored the ,Gulf of Saint Lawrence, where, on July 24, he planted a 10-metre (33 ft) cross bearing the words ""Long Live the King of France"" and took possession of the territory ,New France, in the name of ,King Francis I,.,[43], In general the settlements appear to have been short-lived, possibly due to the similarity of outputs producible in Scandinavia and northern Canada and the problems of navigating trade routes at that time.,[44],
,In 1583, Sir ,Humphrey Gilbert,, by the ,royal prerogative, of ,Queen Elizabeth I,, founded ,St. John's, Newfoundland,, as the first North American ,English colony,.,[45], French explorer ,Samuel de Champlain, arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent European settlements at ,Port Royal, (in 1605) and ,Quebec City, (in 1608).,[46], Among the ,colonists, of ,New France,, ,Canadiens, extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and ,Acadians, settled the present-day ,Maritimes,, while ,fur traders, and ,Catholic missionaries, explored the ,Great Lakes,, ,Hudson Bay,, and the ,Mississippi watershed, to ,Louisiana,.,[47], The ,Beaver Wars, broke out in the mid-17th century over control of the ,North American fur trade,.,[48],
,
,  ,Benjamin West,'s ,The Death of General Wolfe, (1771) dramatizes ,James Wolfe,'s death during the ,Battle of the Plains of Abraham, at ,Quebec,.,
,The English established additional settlements in ,Newfoundland,, beginning in 1610,[49], and the ,Thirteen Colonies, to the south were founded soon after.,[42], A series of ,four wars, erupted in colonial North America between 1689 and 1763; the later wars of the period constituted the North American theatre of the ,Seven Years' War,.,[50], Mainland ,Nova Scotia, came under British rule with the 1713 ,Treaty of Utrecht,, and Canada and most of New France came under British rule in 1763 after the Seven Years' War.,[51],
,The ,Royal Proclamation of 1763, established First Nation treaty rights, created the ,Province of Quebec, out of New France, and annexed ,Cape Breton Island, to Nova Scotia.,[16], St. John's Island (now ,Prince Edward Island,) became a separate colony in 1769.,[52], To avert conflict in Quebec, the British Parliament passed the ,Quebec Act, of 1774, expanding Quebec's territory to the Great Lakes and ,Ohio Valley,. More importantly, the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration at a time that the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British rule.,[53], It re-established the ,French language,, ,Catholic faith,, and ,French civil law, there, staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies. The ,Proclamation, and the ,Quebec Act, in turn angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies, further fuelling anti-British sentiment in the years prior to the ,American Revolution,.,[16],
,After the successful American War of Independence, the ,1783 Treaty of Paris, recognized the independence of the newly formed United States and set the terms of peace, ceding British North American territories south of the Great Lakes to the new country.,[54], The American war of independence also caused a large out-migration of ,Loyalists, the settlers who had fought against American independence. Many moved to Canada, particularly Atlantic Canada, where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories. ,New Brunswick, was in turn split from Nova Scotia as part of a reorganization of Loyalist settlements in the Maritimes which led to the incorporation of ,Saint John, New Brunswick, to become Canada's first city.,[55], To accommodate the influx of English-speaking Loyalists in Central Canada, the ,Constitutional Act, of 1791 divided the province of Canada into French-speaking ,Lower Canada, (later ,Quebec,) and English-speaking ,Upper Canada, (later ,Ontario,), granting each its own elected legislative assembly.,[56],
,The Canadas, were the main front in the ,War of 1812, between the United States and the ,United Kingdom,. Peace came in 1815; no boundaries were changed. Immigration resumed at a higher level, with over 960,000 arrivals from Britain between 1815 and 1850.,[57], New arrivals included refugees escaping the ,Great Irish Famine, as well as ,Gaelic,-speaking Scots displaced by the ,Highland Clearances,.,[58], Infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 percent of Europeans who immigrated to Canada before 1891.,[26],
,The desire for ,responsible government, resulted in the abortive ,Rebellions of 1837,.,[59], The ,Durham Report, subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into English culture.,[16], The ,Act of Union, merged the Canadas into a united ,Province of Canada, and responsible government was established for all provinces of ,British North America, by 1849.,[60], The signing of the ,Oregon Treaty, by Britain and ,the United States in 1846, ended the ,Oregon boundary dispute,, extending the border westward along the ,49th parallel,. This paved the way for British colonies on ,Vancouver Island (1849), and in ,British Columbia (1858),.,[61], In 1867, the same year as Canadian Confederation, Britain declined to purchase for Canada the Alaska territory that was to that point tenuously held by Russia. With ,the United States purchasing Alaska, instead, clearly demarcated borders for Canada, although there would continue to be some disputes about the exact demarcation of the Alaska-Yukon and Alaska-BC border for years to come.,[62],
,
,Confederation and expansion,
,  ,An animated map showing ,the growth and change of Canada's provinces and territories, since Confederation in 1867,
,Following several constitutional conferences, the ,Constitution Act, officially proclaimed ,Canadian Confederation, on July 1, 1867, initially with four provinces: ,Ontario,, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick.,[63],[64], Canada assumed control of ,Rupert's Land, and the ,North-Western Territory, to form the ,Northwest Territories,, where the Métis' grievances ignited the ,Red River Rebellion, and the creation of the province of ,Manitoba, in July 1870.,[65], British Columbia and Vancouver Island (which ,had been united, in 1866) joined the confederation in 1871, while Prince Edward Island joined in 1873.,[66],
,To open ,the West, to European immigration, parliament also approved sponsoring the construction of three transcontinental railways (including the ,Canadian Pacific Railway,), opening the prairies to settlement with the ,Dominion Lands Act,, and establishing the ,North-West Mounted Police, to assert its authority over this territory.,[67],[68], In 1898, during the ,Klondike Gold Rush, in the Northwest Territories, parliament created the Yukon Territory. ,Alberta, and ,Saskatchewan, became provinces in 1905.,[66],

,Because Britain still maintained control of Canada's foreign affairs under the ,Constitution Act, 1867,, its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought ,Canada into World War I,.,[69], Volunteers sent to the ,Western Front, later became part of the ,Canadian Corps,, which played a substantial role in the ,Battle of Vimy Ridge, and other major engagements of the war.,[70], Out of approximately 625,000 Canadians who served in World War I, some 60,000 were killed and another 172,000 were wounded.,[71], The ,Conscription Crisis of 1917, erupted when the ,Unionist, Cabinet's proposal to augment the military's dwindling number of active members with ,conscription, was met with vehement objections from French-speaking Quebecers.,[72], The Military Service Act brought in compulsory military service, though it, coupled with disputes over French language schools outside Quebec, deeply alienated Francophone Canadians and temporarily split the Liberal Party.,[72], In 1919, Canada joined the ,League of Nations, independently of Britain,,[70], and the ,1931 Statute of Westminster, affirmed Canada's independence.,[4],
,

,The ,Great Depression in Canada, during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn, leading to hardship across the country.,[73], In response to the downturn, the ,Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, (CCF) in Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a ,welfare state, (as pioneered by ,Tommy Douglas,) in the 1940s and 1950s.,[74], On the advice of Prime Minister ,William Lyon Mackenzie King,, ,war with Germany was declared, effective September 10, 1939, by King ,George VI,, seven days after the United Kingdom. The delay underscored Canada's independence.,[70],
,The first Canadian Army units arrived in Britain in December 1939. In all, over a million Canadians served in the ,armed forces during World War II, and approximately 42,000 were killed and another 55,000 were wounded.,[75], Canadian troops played important roles in many key battles of the war, including the failed 1942 ,Dieppe Raid,, the ,Allied invasion of Italy,, the ,Normandy landings,, the ,Battle of Normandy,, and the ,Battle of the Scheldt, in 1944.,[70], Canada provided asylum for the ,Dutch monarchy, while that country was ,occupied, and is credited by the Netherlands for major contributions to ,its liberation, from ,Nazi Germany,.,[76],
,The Canadian economy boomed during the war as its industries manufactured military ,materiel, for Canada, Britain, ,China,, and the ,Soviet Union,.,[70], Despite another ,Conscription Crisis, in Quebec in 1944, Canada finished the war with a large army and strong economy.,[77],
,
,Contemporary era,
,  ,At ,Rideau Hall,, ,Governor General, ,the Viscount Alexander of Tunis, (centre) receives the bill finalizing the union of ,Newfoundland, and Canada on March 31, 1949,
,The financial crisis of the ,Great Depression, had led the ,Dominion of Newfoundland, to relinquish responsible government in 1934 and become a ,crown colony, ruled by a British governor.,[78], After two bitter ,referendums,, Newfoundlanders voted to join Canada in 1949 as a province.,[79],
,Canada's post-war economic growth, combined with the policies of successive Liberal governments, led to the emergence of a new ,Canadian identity,, marked by the adoption of the ,Maple Leaf Flag, in 1965,,[80], the implementation of ,official bilingualism, (English and French) in 1969,,[81], and the institution of ,official multiculturalism, in 1971.,[82], ,Socially democratic, programs were also instituted, such as ,Medicare,, the ,Canada Pension Plan,, and ,Canada Student Loans,, though provincial governments, particularly Quebec and Alberta, opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions.,[83],
,Finally, another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the ,Canada Act,, the ,patriation, of Canada's constitution from the United Kingdom, concurrent with the creation of the ,Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms,.,[84],[85],[86], Canada had established complete sovereignty as an independent country, although the Queen retained her role as monarch of Canada.,[87],[88], In 1999, ,Nunavut, became Canada's third territory after a series of negotiations with the federal government.,[89],
,At the same time, Quebec underwent profound social and economic changes through the ,Quiet Revolution, of the 1960s, giving birth to a secular ,nationalist, movement.,[90], The radical ,Front de libération du Québec, (FLQ) ignited the ,October Crisis, with a series of bombings and kidnappings in 1970,[91], and the ,sovereignist, ,Parti Québécois, was elected in 1976, organizing an ,unsuccessful referendum, on sovereignty-association in 1980. Attempts to accommodate Quebec nationalism constitutionally through the ,Meech Lake Accord, failed in 1990.,[92], This led to the formation of the ,Bloc Québécois, in Quebec and the invigoration of the ,Reform Party of Canada, in the West.,[93],[94], A ,second referendum, followed in 1995, in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent.,[95], In 1997, the ,Supreme Court, ruled that ,unilateral secession, by a province would be unconstitutional and the ,Clarity Act, was passed by parliament, outlining the terms of a negotiated departure from Confederation.,[92],
,In addition to the issues of Quebec sovereignty, a number of crises shook Canadian society in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These included the explosion of ,Air India Flight 182, in 1985, the largest mass murder in Canadian history;,[96], the ,École Polytechnique massacre, in 1989, a ,university shooting, targeting female students;,[97], and the ,Oka Crisis, of 1990,,[98], the first of a number of violent confrontations between the government and indigenous groups.,[99], Canada also joined the ,Gulf War, in 1990 as part of a US-led coalition force and was active in several peacekeeping missions in the 1990s, including the ,UNPROFOR, mission in the ,former Yugoslavia,.,[100],
,Canada sent ,troops to Afghanistan in 2001,, but declined to join the U.S.-led ,invasion of Iraq in 2003,.,[101], In 2011, Canadian forces participated in the NATO-led intervention into the ,Libyan Civil War,,,[102], and also became involved in battling the ,Islamic State, insurgency in Iraq in the mid-2010s.,[103],

,Geography and climate,
,Main articles: ,Geography of Canada, and ,Climate of Canada,
,  ,Köppen climate types, of Canada,
,Canada occupies much of the continent of North America, sharing ,land borders, with the ,contiguous United States, to the south, and the U.S. state of ,Alaska, to the northwest. Canada stretches from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west; to the north lies the Arctic Ocean.,[104], ,Greenland, is to the northeast and to the southeast Canada shares a ,maritime boundary, with the ,Republic of France,'s ,overseas collectivity, of ,Saint Pierre and Miquelon,, the last vestige of ,New France,.,[105], By total area (including its waters), Canada is the ,second-largest country, in the world, after ,Russia,. By land area alone, however, Canada ,ranks fourth,, the difference being due to it having the world's largest proportion of fresh water lakes.,[106], Of Canada's ,thirteen provinces and territories,, only two are landlocked (Alberta and Saskatchewan) while the other eleven all directly border one of three oceans.
,Canada is home to the world's northernmost settlement, ,Canadian Forces Station Alert,, on the northern tip of ,Ellesmere Island, – latitude 82.5°N – which lies 817 kilometres (508 mi) from the North Pole.,[107], Much of the ,Canadian Arctic, is covered by ice and ,permafrost,. Canada has the longest coastline in the world, with a total length of 243,042 kilometres (151,019 mi);,[108], additionally, its border with the United States is the world's longest land border, stretching 8,891 kilometres (5,525 mi).,[109], Three of Canada's arctic islands, ,Baffin Island,, ,Victoria Island, and ,Ellesmere Island,, are among the ten largest in the world.,[110],
,Since the end of the last ,glacial period,, Canada has consisted of ,eight distinct forest regions,, including extensive ,boreal, forest on the Canadian Shield.,[111], Canada has over 2,000,000 lakes—563 greater than 100 km,2, (39 sq mi)—which is more than any other country, containing much of the world's ,fresh water,.,[112],[113],
There are also fresh-water glaciers in the ,Canadian Rockies, and the ,Coast Mountains,.,[114],
,
,  ,The ,Mount Meager massif, as seen from the east near ,Pemberton,. Summits left to right are ,Capricorn Mountain,, ,Mount Meager, and ,Plinth Peak,.,
,Canada is geologically active, having many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes, notably ,Mount Meager massif,, ,Mount Garibaldi,, ,Mount Cayley massif,, and the ,Mount Edziza volcanic complex,.,[115], The volcanic eruption of the ,Tseax Cone, in 1775 was among Canada's worst natural disasters, killing an estimated 2,000 ,Nisga'a people, and destroying their village in the ,Nass River, valley of northern British Columbia.,[116], The eruption produced a 22.5-kilometre (14.0 mi) ,lava, flow, and, according to Nisga'a legend, blocked the flow of the Nass River.,[117],
,Average winter and summer high ,temperatures across Canada, vary from region to region. Winters can be harsh in many parts of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces, which experience a ,continental climate,, where daily average temperatures are near −15 °,C, (5 °,F,), but can drop below −40 °C (−40 °F) with severe ,wind chills,.,[118], In noncoastal regions, snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while in parts of the north snow can persist year-round. Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter. On the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s °C (70s °F), while between the coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30 °C (77 to 86 °F), with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40 °C (104 °F).,[119],

,Canada is described as a "",full democracy,"",,[120], with a tradition of ,liberalism,,,[121], and an ,egalitarian,,,[122], ,moderate, political ideology.,[123], An emphasis on ,social justice, has been a distinguishing element of Canada's political culture.,[124], ,Peace, order, and good government, are founding principles of the Canadian government.,[125], Canada has been dominated by two relatively ,centrist, political parties at the federal level,,[126],[127],[128],[129], the ,centre-left, ,Liberal Party of Canada, and the ,centre-right,  ,Conservative Party of Canada, (or its ,predecessors,).,[130], The historically predominant Liberal Party position themselves at the center of the Canadian political spectrum, with the Conservative Party positioned on the right and the ,New Democratic Party, occupying the ,left,.,[126],[131],[128],[131], ,Far-right and far-left politics, have never been a prominent force in Canadian society.,[132],[133],  Five parties had representatives elected to the federal parliament in the 2015 election: the Liberal Party who currently form the government, the Conservative Party who are the ,Official Opposition,, the New Democratic Party, the ,Bloc Québécois,, and the ,Green Party of Canada,.,[134],
,Canada has a ,parliamentary system, within the context of a ,constitutional monarchy,, the ,monarchy of Canada, being the foundation of the executive, ,legislative,, and ,judicial, branches.,[135],[136],[137],  The Canadian monarchy is a separate legal institution from the monarchy of the ,United Kingdom,, though the two offices are held by the same individual.,[138], The sovereign is Queen ,Elizabeth II,, who is also monarch of ,15 other Commonwealth countries, and each of Canada's 10 provinces. As such, the Queen's representative, the ,Governor General of Canada, (at present ,Julie Payette,), carries out most of the federal royal duties in Canada.,[139],[140],
,
,  ,Parliament Hill, in Canada's capital city, ,Ottawa,
,The direct participation of the royal and viceroyal figures in areas of governance is limited.,[137],[141],[142], In practice, their use of the executive powers is directed by ,the Cabinet,, a committee of ,ministers of the Crown, responsible to the elected ,House of Commons of Canada, and chosen and headed by the ,Prime Minister of Canada, (at present ,Justin Trudeau,),,[143], the ,head of government,. The governor general or monarch may, though, in certain crisis situations exercise their power without ministerial ,advice,.,[141], To ensure the stability of government, the governor general will usually appoint as prime minister the person who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a ,plurality, in the House of Commons.,[144], The ,Prime Minister's Office, (PMO) is thus one of the most powerful institutions in government, initiating most legislation for parliamentary approval and selecting for appointment by the Crown, besides the aforementioned, the governor general, ,lieutenant governors,, senators, federal court judges, and heads of ,Crown corporations, and government agencies.,[141], The leader of the party with the second-most seats usually becomes the ,Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, and is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended to keep the government in check.,[145],
,
,  ,The ,Senate chamber, within the ,Centre Block, on ,Parliament Hill,
,Each of the 338 members of parliament in the House of Commons is elected by simple plurality in an ,electoral district, or riding. ,General elections, must be called by the governor general, either on the advice of the prime minister or if the government loses a ,confidence vote, in the House.,[146],[147], Constitutionally, an election may be held no more than five years after the preceding election, although the ,Canada Elections Act, limits this to four years with a fixed election date in October. The 105 members of the Senate, whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis, serve until age 75.,[148],
,Canada's federal structure, divides government responsibilities between the federal government and the ten provinces. ,Provincial legislatures, are ,unicameral, and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the House of Commons.,[142], Canada's three territories also have legislatures, but these are not sovereign and have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces.,[149], The territorial legislatures also differ structurally from their provincial counterparts.,[150],
,The ,Bank of Canada, is the ,central bank, of the country. In addition, the ,Minister of Finance, and ,Minister of Industry, utilize the ,Statistics Canada, agency for financial planning and economic policy development.,[151], The Bank of Canada is the sole authority authorized to issue currency in the form of ,Canadian bank notes,.,[152], The bank does not issue ,Canadian coins,; they are issued by the ,Royal Canadian Mint,.,[153],
,
,Law,
,Main article: ,Law of Canada,
,The ,Constitution of Canada, is the supreme law of the country, and consists of written text and unwritten conventions.,[154], The Constitution Act, 1867 (known as the ,British North America Act, prior to 1982), affirmed governance based on parliamentary precedent and divided powers between the federal and provincial governments.,[155], The ,Statute of Westminster 1931, granted full autonomy and the ,Constitution Act, 1982,, ended all legislative ties to the UK, as well as adding a constitutional amending formula and the ,Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms,.,[156], The Charter guarantees basic rights and freedoms that usually cannot be over-ridden by any government—though a ,notwithstanding clause, allows the federal parliament and provincial legislatures to override certain sections of the Charter for a period of five years.,[157],

,The ,Indian Act,, various treaties and case laws were established to mediate relations between Europeans and native peoples.,[158], Most notably, a series of eleven treaties known as the ,Numbered Treaties, were signed between the indigenous and the reigning Monarch of Canada between 1871 and 1921.,[159], These treaties are agreements with the Canadian ,Crown-in-Council,, administered by ,Canadian Aboriginal law,, and overseen by the ,Minister of Indigenous and Northern Development,. The role of the treaties and the rights they support were reaffirmed by ,Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982,.,[158], These rights may include provision of services, such as health care, and exemption from taxation.,[160], The legal and policy framework within which Canada and First Nations operate was further formalized in 2005, through the First Nations–Federal Crown Political Accord.,[158],

,  ,The ,Supreme Court of Canada, in Ottawa, west of Parliament Hill,
,Canada's judiciary, plays an important role in interpreting laws and has the power to strike down Acts of Parliament that violate the constitution. The ,Supreme Court of Canada, is the highest court and final arbiter and has been led since December 18, 2017 by Chief Justice ,Richard Wagner,.,[161], Its nine members are appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister and minister of justice. All judges at the superior and appellate levels are appointed after consultation with non-governmental legal bodies. The federal Cabinet also appoints justices to superior courts in the provincial and territorial jurisdictions.,[162],
,Common law, prevails everywhere except in Quebec, where ,civil law, predominates. ,Criminal law, is solely a federal responsibility and is uniform throughout Canada.,[163], Law enforcement, including criminal courts, is officially a provincial responsibility, conducted by provincial and municipal police forces.,[164], However, in most rural areas and some urban areas, policing responsibilities are contracted to the federal ,Royal Canadian Mounted Police,.,[165],

,Canada and the United States, share the world's longest undefended border, co-operate on military campaigns and exercises, and are each other's ,largest trading partner,.,[174],[175], Canada nevertheless has an independent foreign policy, most notably maintaining full ,relations with Cuba,, and declining to officially participate in the ,2003 invasion of Iraq,.,[176], Canada also maintains historic ties to the ,United Kingdom, and ,France, and to other former British and French colonies through Canada's membership in the ,Commonwealth of Nations, and the ,Francophonie,.,[177], Canada is noted for having a positive ,relationship with the Netherlands,, owing, in part, to its contribution to the ,Dutch liberation during World War II,.,[76],
,Canada's strong attachment to the British Empire and Commonwealth led to major participation in British military efforts in the ,Second Boer War,, World War I and World War II.,[178], Since then, Canada has been an advocate for multilateralism, making efforts to resolve global issues in collaboration with other nations.,[179],[180], During the ,Cold War,, Canada was a major contributor to UN forces in the ,Korean War, and founded the ,North American Aerospace Defense Command, (NORAD) in co-operation with the United States to defend against potential aerial attacks from the Soviet Union.,[181],
,During the ,Suez Crisis, of 1956, future Prime Minister ,Lester B. Pearson, eased tensions by proposing the inception of the ,United Nations Peacekeeping Force,, for which he was awarded the 1957 ,Nobel Peace Prize,.,[182], As this was the first UN peacekeeping mission, Pearson is often credited as the inventor of the concept.,[183], Canada has since served in over 50 peacekeeping missions, including every UN peacekeeping effort until 1989,,[70], and has since maintained forces in international missions in ,Rwanda,, the former ,Yugoslavia,, and elsewhere; Canada has sometimes faced controversy over its involvement in foreign countries, notably in the 1993 ,Somalia Affair,.,[184],

,  ,A map of Canada showing its 13 provinces and territories,
,Canada is a federation composed of ten provinces and three ,territories,. In turn, these may be grouped into ,four main regions,: ,Western Canada,, ,Central Canada,, ,Atlantic Canada,, and ,Northern Canada, (,Eastern Canada, refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together). Provinces have more autonomy than territories, having responsibility for social programs such as ,health care,, ,education,, and ,welfare,.,[192], Together, the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, an almost unique structure among federations in the world. Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the ,Canada Health Act,; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. ,Equalization payments, are made by the federal government to ensure that reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.,[193], The major difference between a Canadian province and a territory is that provinces receive their power and authority from the ,Constitution Act, 1867, (formerly called the ,British North America Act,, 1867,), whereas territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the ,Parliament of Canada,. The powers flowing from the Constitution Act are divided between the ,Government of Canada, (the federal government) and the provincial governments to exercise exclusively. A change to the division of powers between the federal government and the provinces requires a ,constitutional amendment,, whereas a similar change affecting the territories can be performed unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada or government.,[194],

,Since the early 20th century, the growth of Canada's manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy to an urbanized, industrial one.,[206], Like many other ,developed countries,, the Canadian economy is dominated by the ,service industry,, which employs about three-quarters of the country's workforce.,[207], However, Canada is unusual among developed countries in the importance of its ,primary sector,, in which the ,forestry, and ,petroleum industries, are two of the most prominent components.,[208],
,Canada is one of the few developed nations that are net exporters of energy.,[209], Atlantic Canada possesses vast ,offshore, deposits of natural gas, and Alberta also hosts large oil and gas resources. The vastness of the ,Athabasca oil sands, and other assets results in Canada having a 13% share of global ,oil reserves,, comprising the world's third-largest share after ,Venezuela, and ,Saudi Arabia,.,[210], Canada is additionally one of the world's largest suppliers of agricultural products; the Canadian Prairies are one of the most important global producers of wheat, ,canola,, and other grains.,[211], Canada's ,Ministry of Natural Resources, provides statistics regarding its major exports; the country is a leading exporter of ,zinc,, ,uranium,, ,gold,, ,nickel,, ,aluminum,, ,steel,, ,iron ore,, ,coking coal, and ,lead,.,[212], Many towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, are sustainable because of nearby mines or sources of timber. Canada also has a sizeable manufacturing sector centred in southern Ontario and Quebec, with automobiles and ,aeronautics, representing particularly important industries.,[213],
,Canada's economic integration with the United States has increased significantly since ,World War II,.,[214], The ,Automotive Products Trade Agreement, of 1965 opened Canada's borders to trade in the automobile manufacturing industry.,[215], In the 1970s, concerns over energy self-sufficiency and foreign ownership in the manufacturing sectors prompted Prime Minister ,Pierre Trudeau,'s Liberal government to enact the ,National Energy Program, (NEP) and the ,Foreign Investment Review Agency, (FIRA).,[216], In the 1980s, Prime Minister ,Brian Mulroney,'s Progressive Conservatives abolished the NEP and changed the name of FIRA to ,Investment Canada,, to encourage foreign investment.,[217], The ,Canada – United States Free Trade Agreement, (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while the ,North American Free Trade Agreement, (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include ,Mexico, in 1994.,[211],

,The ,Canada 2016 Census, enumerated a ,total population, of 35,151,728, an increase of around 5.0 percent over the 2011 figure.,[234],[235], Between 2011 and May 2016, Canada's population grew by 1.7 million people, with immigrants accounting for two-thirds of the increase.,[236], Between 1990 and 2008, the population increased by 5.6 million, equivalent to 20.4 percent overall growth.,[237], The main drivers of population growth are ,immigration, and, to a lesser extent, natural growth.,[238],
,Canada has one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the world,,[239], driven mainly by ,economic policy, and, to a lesser extent, ,family reunification,.,[240],[241], The Canadian public as-well as the major political parties support the current level of immigration.,[240],[242], In 2014, a total of 260,400 immigrants were admitted to Canada, mainly from Asia.,[243], The Canadian government anticipated between 280,000 and 305,000 new permanent residents in the following years,,[244],[245], a similar number of immigrants as in recent years.,[246], New immigrants settle mostly in major urban areas such as ,Toronto,, ,Montreal, and ,Vancouver,.,[247], Canada also accepts large numbers of ,refugees,,,[248], accounting for over 10 percent of annual global ,refugee resettlements,.,[249],
,Canada's population density, at 3.7 inhabitants per square kilometre (9.6/sq mi), is among the lowest in the world.,[250], Canada spans latitudinally from the 83rd parallel north to the 41st parallel north, and approximately 95% of the population is found south of the 55th parallel north.,[251], About four-fifths of the population lives within 150 kilometres (93 mi) of the ,contiguous United States, border.,[252], The most densely populated part of the country, accounting for nearly 50 percent, is the ,Quebec City–Windsor Corridor,, situated in Southern Quebec and Southern Ontario along the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence River.,[233],[251], An additional 30 percent live along the British Columbia ,Lower Mainland,, and the ,Calgary–Edmonton Corridor, in Alberta.,[253],
,In common with many other developed countries, Canada is experiencing a ,demographic shift, towards an older population, with more retirees and fewer people of working age. In 2006, the average age was 39.5 years;,[254], by 2011, it had risen to approximately 39.9 years.,[255],
,As of  2013,[update],, the average ,life expectancy, for Canadians is 81 years.,[256], The majority of Canadians (69.9%) live in family households, 26.8% report living alone, and those living with unrelated persons reported at 3.7%.,[257], The average size of a household in 2006 was 2.5 people.,[257],

,According to the ,2016 census,, the country's largest ,self-reported ethnic origin, is Canadian (accounting for 32% of the population),,[b], followed by ,English, (18.3%), ,Scottish, (13.9%), ,French, (13.6%), ,Irish, (13.4%), ,German, (9.6%), ,Chinese, (5.1%), ,Italian, (4.6%), ,First Nations, (4.4%), ,Indian, (4.0%), and ,Ukrainian, (3.9%).,[267], There are 600 recognized ,First Nations governments or bands,, encompassing a total of 1,525,565 people.,[268], Canada's indigenous population is growing at almost twice the national rate, and four percent of Canada's population claimed an indigenous identity in 2006. Another 22.3 percent of the population belonged to a non-indigenous ,visible minority,.,[269], In 2016, the largest visible minority groups were ,South Asian, (5.6%), Chinese (5.1%) and ,Black, (3.5%).,[269], Between 2011 and 2016, the visible minority population rose by 18.4 percent.,[269], In 1961, less than two percent of Canada's population (about 300,000 people) were members of visible minority groups.,[270], Indigenous peoples are not considered a visible minority under the ,Employment Equity Act,,,[271], and this is the definition that Statistics Canada also uses.

,Canada is religiously diverse, encompassing a wide range of beliefs and customs. Canada has no official church, and the government is officially committed to ,religious pluralism,.,[272], ,Freedom of religion in Canada, is a constitutionally protected right, allowing individuals to assemble and worship without limitation or interference.,[273], The practice of religion is now generally considered a private matter throughout society and the state.,[274], With ,Christianity, in decline after having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life,,[275], Canada has become a ,post-Christian,, ,secular, state.,[276],[277],[278],[279], The majority of Canadians consider ,religion to be unimportant, in their daily lives,,[280], but still believe in God.,[281], According to the 2011 census, 67.3% of Canadians identify as Christian; of these, ,Roman Catholics, make up the largest group, accounting for 38.7% of the population. Much of the remainder is made up of ,Protestants,, who accounted for approximately 27% in a 2011 survey.,[282],[283], The largest Protestant ,denomination, is the ,United Church of Canada, (accounting for 6.1% of Canadians), followed by ,Anglicans, (5.0%), and ,Baptists, (1.9%).,[3], Secularization has been growing since the 1960s.,[284],[285], In 2011, 23.9% declared ,no religious affiliation,, compared to 16.5% in 2001.,[286], The remaining 8.8% are affiliated with non-Christian religions, the largest of which are ,Islam, (3.2%), ,Hinduism, (1.5%) and ,Sikhism, (1.4%).,[3],

,A multitude of languages are used by Canadians, with ,English, and ,French, (the ,official languages,) being the ,mother tongues, of approximately 56% and 21% of Canadians, respectively.,[288], As of the 2016 Census, just over 7.3 million Canadians listed a non-official language as their mother tongue. Some of the most common non-official first languages include ,Chinese, (1,227,680 first-language speakers), ,Punjabi, (501,680), ,Spanish, (458,850), ,Tagalog, (431,385), ,Arabic, (419,895), ,German, (384,040), and ,Italian, (375,645).,[288], Canada's federal government practices ,official bilingualism,, which is applied by the ,Commissioner of Official Languages, in consonance with ,Section 16 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and the Federal ,Official Languages Act, English and French have equal status in federal courts, parliament, and in all federal institutions. Citizens have the right, where there is sufficient demand, to receive federal government services in either English or French and official-,language minorities, are guaranteed their own schools in all provinces and territories.,[289],
,The 1977 ,Charter of the French Language, established French as the official language of Quebec.,[290], Although more than 85 percent of French-speaking Canadians live in Quebec, there are substantial ,Francophone, populations in ,New Brunswick,, ,Alberta,, and ,Manitoba,; ,Ontario, has the largest French-speaking population outside Quebec.,[291], New Brunswick, the only officially bilingual province, has a French-speaking Acadian minority constituting 33 percent of the population.,[292], There are also clusters of Acadians in southwestern Nova Scotia, on Cape Breton Island, and through central and western Prince Edward Island.,[293],
,Other provinces have no official languages as such, but French is used as a language of instruction, in courts, and for other government services, in addition to English. Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec allow for both English and French to be spoken in the provincial legislatures, and laws are enacted in both languages. In Ontario, French has some legal status, but is not fully co-official.,[294], There are 11 ,indigenous language groups,, composed of more than 65 distinct languages and dialects.,[295], Of these, only the ,Cree,, ,Inuktitut, and ,Ojibway, languages have a large enough population of fluent speakers to be considered viable to ,survive in the long term,.,[296], Several indigenous languages have official status in the Northwest Territories.,[297], Inuktitut is the majority language in Nunavut, and is one of three official languages in the territory.,[298],
,Additionally, Canada is home to many ,sign languages,, some of which are Indigenous.,[299], ,American Sign Language, (ASL) is spoken across the country due to the prevalence of ASL in primary and secondary schools.,[300], Due to its historical relation to the francophone culture, ,Quebec Sign Language, (LSQ) is spoken primarily in Quebec, although there are sizeable Francophone communities in New Brunswick, Ontario and Manitoba.,[301],

,Canada's culture draws influences from its broad range of constituent nationalities, and policies that promote a "",just society,"" are constitutionally protected.,[302],[303], Canada has placed emphasis on equality and inclusiveness for all its people.,[304], ,Multiculturalism, is often cited as one of Canada's significant accomplishments,,[305], and a key distinguishing element of ,Canadian identity,.,[306],[307], In Quebec, cultural identity is strong, and many commentators speak of a ,French Canadian culture, that is distinct from English Canadian culture.,[308], However, as a whole, Canada is, in theory, a ,cultural mosaic,—a collection of regional ethnic subcultures.,[309],
,Canada's approach to governance emphasizing multiculturalism, which is based on selective ,immigration,, ,social integration,, and ,suppression, of far-right politics, has wide public support.,[310], Government policies such as ,publicly funded health care,, ,higher taxation, to ,redistribute wealth,, the outlawing of ,capital punishment,, strong efforts to eliminate ,poverty,, strict ,gun control,, the legalization of ,same-sex marriage, and ,cannabis, are further social indicators of Canada's political and ,cultural values,.,[311],[312], Canadians also identify with the country's ,foreign aid policies,, ,peacekeeping roles,, the ,National park system, and the ,Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms,.,[306],[313],

,Historically, Canada has been influenced by ,British,, ,French,, and indigenous cultures and traditions. Through their language, ,art, and ,music,, Indigenous peoples continue to influence the Canadian identity.,[314], During the 20th century, Canadians with African, Caribbean and Asian nationalities have added to the Canadian identity and its culture.,[315], ,Canadian humour, is an integral part of the Canadian identity and is reflected in its ,folklore,, literature, music, art, and media. The primary characteristics of Canadian humour are irony, parody, and satire.,[316], Many ,Canadian comedians, have achieved international success in the American TV and film industries and are amongst the most recognized in the world.,[317],
,Canada has a well-developed ,media sector,, but its cultural output; particularly in ,English films,, ,television shows,, and ,magazines,, is often overshadowed by imports from the United States.,[318], As a result, the preservation of a distinctly Canadian culture is supported by federal government programs, laws, and institutions such as the ,Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, (CBC), the ,National Film Board of Canada, (NFB), and the ,Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, (CRTC).,[319],

,Symbols,
,Main article: ,National symbols of Canada,
,  ,The mother beaver, on the Canadian parliament's ,Peace Tower,[320], The five flowers on the shield each represent an ethnicity: ,Tudor rose,: ,English,; ,Fleur de lis,: ,French,; ,thistle,: ,Scottish,; ,shamrock,: ,Irish,; and ,leek,: ,Welsh,.,
,Canada's national symbols are influenced by natural, historical, and indigenous sources. The use of the ,maple leaf, as a Canadian symbol dates to the early 18th century. The maple leaf is depicted on Canada's ,current, and ,previous flags,, and on the ,Arms of Canada,.,[321], The Arms of Canada are closely modelled after the ,royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version.,[322], The ,Great Seal of Canada, is a governmental ,seal, used for purposes of state, being set on ,letters patent,, proclamations and commissions, for representatives of the Queen and for the appointment of ,cabinet ministers,, ,lieutenant governors,, senators, and judges.,[323],[324], Other prominent symbols include the ,beaver,, ,Canada goose,, and ,common loon,, the Crown, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,,[321], and more recently the ,totem pole, and ,Inuksuk,.,[325], ,Canadian coins, feature many of these symbols: the loon on the ,$1 coin,, the Arms of Canada on the ,50¢ piece,, the beaver on the ,nickel,.,[326], The ,penny,, removed from circulation in 2013, featured the maple leaf.,[327], The Queen' s image appears on ,$20 bank notes,, and on the obverse of all current Canadian coins.,[326],
,
,Literature,
,Main article: ,Canadian literature,
,Canadian literature is often divided into French- and English-language literatures, which are rooted in the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively.,[328], There are four major themes that can be found within historical Canadian literature; nature, frontier life, Canada's position within the world, all three of which tie into the ,garrison mentality,.,[329], By the 1990s, Canadian literature was viewed as some of the world's best.,[330], Canada's ethnic and cultural diversity are reflected in its literature, with many of its most prominent modern writers focusing on ethnic life.,[331], Arguably, the best-known living Canadian writer internationally (especially since the deaths of ,Robertson Davies, and ,Mordecai Richler,) is ,Margaret Atwood,, a prolific novelist, poet, and literary critic.,[332], Numerous other ,Canadian authors, have accumulated international literary awards;,[333], including ,Nobel Laureate, ,Alice Munro,, who has been called the best living writer of short stories in English;,[334], and ,Booker Prize, recipient ,Michael Ondaatje,, who is perhaps best known for the novel ,The English Patient,, which was adapted as a ,film of the same name, that won the ,Academy Award for Best Picture,.,[335],

,Visual arts,
,Main article: ,Canadian art,
,  ,The Jack Pine, by ,Tom Thomson,. Oil on canvas, 1916, in the collection of the ,National Gallery of Canada,
,Canadian visual art has been dominated by figures such as ,Tom Thomson, – the country's most famous painter – and by the ,Group of Seven,.,[336], Thomson's career painting Canadian landscapes spanned a decade up to his death in 1917 at age 39.,[337], The Group were painters with a nationalistic and idealistic focus, who first exhibited their distinctive works in May 1920. Though referred to as having seven members, five artists—,Lawren Harris,, ,A. Y. Jackson,, ,Arthur Lismer,, ,J. E. H. MacDonald,, and ,Frederick Varley,—were responsible for articulating the Group's ideas. They were joined briefly by ,Frank Johnston,, and by commercial artist ,Franklin Carmichael,. ,A. J. Casson, became part of the Group in 1926.,[338], Associated with the Group was another prominent Canadian artist, ,Emily Carr,, known for her landscapes and portrayals of the ,Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast,.,[339], Since the 1950s, works of ,Inuit art, have been given as gifts to foreign dignitaries by the Canadian government.,[340],
,
,Music,
,Main article: ,Music of Canada,
,The Canadian music industry is the sixth-largest in the world producing internationally renowned ,composers,, ,musicians, and ,ensembles,.,[341], Music broadcasting in the country is regulated by the CRTC.,[342], The ,Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, presents Canada's music industry awards, the ,Juno Awards,, which were first awarded in 1970.,[343], The ,Canadian Music Hall of Fame, established in 1976 honours Canadian musicians for their lifetime achievements.,[344], ,Patriotic music in Canada, dates back over 200 years as a distinct category from British patriotism, preceding the ,first legal steps to independence, by over 50 years. The earliest, ,The Bold Canadian,, was written in 1812.,[345], The national anthem of Canada, "",O Canada,"", was originally commissioned by the ,Lieutenant Governor of Quebec,, the Honourable ,Théodore Robitaille,, for the 1880 ,St. Jean-Baptiste Day, ceremony, and was officially adopted in 1980.,[346], ,Calixa Lavallée, wrote the music, which was a setting of a patriotic poem composed by the poet and judge Sir ,Adolphe-Basile Routhier,. The text was originally only in French before it was adapted into English in 1906.,[347],

Other popular professional sports in Canada include ,Canadian football,, which is played in the ,Canadian Football League,, ,National Lacrosse League, lacrosse, and ,curling,.,[352],

,^, ,All citizens of Canada are classified as ""Canadians"" as defined by ,Canada's nationality laws,. However, ""Canadian"" as an ethnic group has since 1996 been added to census questionnaires for possible ancestry. ""Canadian"" was included as an example on the English
questionnaire and ""Canadien"" as an example on the French questionnaire. ""The majority of respondents to this selection are from the eastern part of the country that was first settled. Respondents generally are visibly European (Anglophones and Francophones), however no-longer self-identify with their ethnic ancestral origins. This response is attributed to a multitude or generational distance from ancestral lineage.

,Emacs, ,/,ˈ,iː,m,æ,k,s,/, is a family of ,text editors, that are characterized by their ,extensibility,.,[3], The manual for the most widely used variant,,[4], ,GNU Emacs,, describes it as ""the extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor"".,[5],  Development of the first Emacs began in the mid-1970s, and work on its direct descendant, GNU Emacs, continues actively as of  2018,[update],.
,Emacs has over 10,000 built-in commands (many of which are macros themselves) and its ,user interface, allows the user to combine these commands into ,macros, to automate work. Implementations of Emacs typically feature a dialect of the ,Lisp, programming language that provides a deep extension capability, allowing users and developers to write new commands and applications for the editor. Extensions have been written to ,manage email,, ,files,, ,outlines,, and ,RSS, feeds,,[6], as well as clones of ,ELIZA,, ,Pong,, ,Conway's Life,, ,Snake, and ,Tetris,.,[7],
,The original EMACS was written in 1976 by ,Carl Mikkelsen,, ,David A. Moon, and ,Guy L. Steele Jr., as a set of ,Editor MACroS, for the ,TECO, editor.,[2],[8],[9],[10],[11], It was inspired by the ideas of the TECO-macro editors TECMAC and TMACS.,[12],
,The most popular, and most ported, version of Emacs is GNU Emacs, which was created by ,Richard Stallman, for the ,GNU Project,.,[13], ,XEmacs, is a variant that ,branched, from GNU Emacs in 1991. GNU Emacs and XEmacs use similar Lisp dialects and are for the most part compatible with each other.
,Emacs is, along with ,vi,, one of the two main contenders in the traditional ,editor wars, of ,Unix, culture. Emacs is among the oldest ,free and open source, projects still under development.,[14],

,History,[,edit,],
,  ,Editing ,C, ,source code, in ,GNU Emacs,
,  ,Editing, compiling and executing ,C++, code from ,GNU Emacs,
,  ,The interface of Emacs was influenced by the design of the ,Symbolics, ,space-cadet keyboard,[15],
,Emacs development began during the 1970s at the ,MIT AI Lab,, whose ,PDP-6, and ,PDP-10, computers used the ,Incompatible Timesharing System, (ITS) ,operating system, that featured a default ,line editor, known as ,Tape Editor and Corrector, (TECO). Unlike most modern text editors, TECO used separate modes in which the user would either add text, edit existing text, or display the document. One could not place characters directly into a document by typing them into TECO, but would instead enter a character ('i') in the TECO command language telling it to switch to input mode, enter the required characters, during which time the edited text was not displayed on the screen, and finally enter a character (<esc>) to switch the editor back to command mode. (A similar technique was used to allow overtyping.) This behavior is similar to that of the program ,ed,.
,Richard Stallman, visited the ,Stanford AI Lab, in 1972 or 1974 and saw the lab's ,E, editor, written by Fred Wright.,[16], He was impressed by the editor's intuitive ,WYSIWYG, (What You See Is What You Get) behavior, which has since become the default behavior of most modern text editors. He returned to MIT where Carl Mikkelsen, a ,hacker, at the AI Lab, had added to TECO a combined display/editing mode called ,Control-R, that allowed the screen display to be updated each time the user entered a keystroke. Stallman reimplemented this mode to run efficiently and then added a ,macro, feature to the TECO display-editing mode that allowed the user to redefine any keystroke to run a TECO program.,[10],
,E had another feature that TECO lacked: random-access editing. TECO was a page-sequential editor that was designed for editing ,paper tape, on the ,PDP-1, and typically allowed editing on only one page at a time, in the order of the pages in the file. Instead of adopting E's approach of structuring the file for page-random access on disk, Stallman modified TECO to handle large buffers more efficiently and changed its file-management method to read, edit, and write the entire file as a single buffer. Almost all modern editors use this approach.
,The new version of TECO quickly became popular at the AI Lab and soon accumulated a large collection of custom macros whose names often ended in ,MAC, or ,MACS,, which stood for ,macro,. Two years later, ,Guy Steele, took on the project of unifying the diverse macros into a single set.,[17], Steele and Stallman's finished implementation included facilities for extending and documenting the new macro set.,[10], The resulting system was called EMACS, which stood for ,Editing MACroS, or, alternatively, ,E with MACroS,. Stallman picked the name Emacs ""because <E> was not in use as an abbreviation on ITS at the time."",[18], An apocryphal ,hacker koan, alleges that the program was named after ,Emack & Bolio's,, a popular ,Cambridge, ice cream store.,[19], The first operational EMACS system existed in late 1976.,[20],
,Stallman saw a problem in too much customization and ,de facto, forking and set certain conditions for usage.,[,citation needed,], He later wrote:,[20],
,
,""EMACS was distributed on a basis of communal sharing, which means all improvements must be given back to me to be incorporated and distributed."",
,The original Emacs, like TECO, ran only on the PDP-10 running ITS. Its behavior was sufficiently different from that of TECO that it could be considered a text editor in its own right, and it quickly became the standard editing program on ITS. ,Mike McMahon, ,ported, Emacs from ITS to the ,TENEX, and ,TOPS-20, operating systems. Other contributors to early versions of Emacs include ,Kent Pitman,, ,Earl Killian,, and ,Eugene Ciccarelli,. By 1979, Emacs was the main editor used in MIT's AI lab and its Laboratory for Computer Science.,[21],
,
,Other early implementations,[,edit,],
,In the following years, programmers wrote a variety of Emacs-like editors for other computer systems. These included ,EINE, (,EINE Is Not EMACS,) and ,ZWEI,[22], (,ZWEI Was EINE Initially,), which were written for the ,Lisp machine, by ,Mike McMahon, and ,Daniel Weinreb,, and Sine (,Sine Is Not Eine,),,[23], which was written by Owen Theodore Anderson. Weinreb's ,EINE, was the first Emacs written in Lisp. In 1978, ,Bernard Greenberg, wrote ,Multics Emacs, almost entirely in Multics Lisp at ,Honeywell,'s Cambridge Information Systems Lab. Multics Emacs was later maintained by ,Richard Soley,, who went on to develop the NILE Emacs-like editor for the NIL Project, and by Barry Margolin. Many versions of Emacs, including GNU Emacs, would later adopt Lisp as an extension language.
,James Gosling,, who would later invent ,NeWS, and the ,Java programming language,, wrote ,Gosling Emacs, in 1981. The first Emacs-like editor to run on ,Unix,, Gosling Emacs was written in ,C, and used ,Mocklisp,, a language with Lisp-like syntax, as an extension language.
,
,GNU Emacs,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,GNU Emacs,

,  ,GNU Emacs running on ,Microsoft Windows,
,Richard Stallman began work on GNU Emacs in 1984 to produce a ,free software, alternative to the proprietary Gosling Emacs. GNU Emacs was initially based on Gosling Emacs, but Stallman's replacement of its Mocklisp interpreter with a true Lisp interpreter required that nearly all of its code be rewritten. This became the first program released by the nascent GNU Project. GNU Emacs is written in C and provides ,Emacs Lisp,, also implemented in C, as an extension language. Version 13, the first public release, was made on March 20, 1985. The first widely distributed version of GNU Emacs was version 15.34, released later in 1985. Early versions of GNU Emacs were numbered as ,1.x.x,, with the initial digit denoting the version of the C core. The ,1, was dropped after version 1.12, as it was thought that the major number would never change, and thus the numbering skipped from ,1, to ,13,.,[24], In September 2014, it was announced on the GNU emacs-devel mailing list that GNU Emacs would adopt a ,rapid release, strategy and version numbers would increment more quickly in the future.,[25],
,GNU Emacs was later ported to Unix. It offered more features than Gosling Emacs, in particular a full-featured Lisp as its extension language, and soon replaced Gosling Emacs as the ,de facto, Unix Emacs editor. ,Markus Hess, exploited a security flaw in GNU Emacs' email subsystem in his 1986 cracking spree in which he gained ,superuser, access to Unix computers.,[26],
,GNU Emacs uses a layered architecture, with a ,Turing complete, language running on top of a smaller central core.  Because about 70% of GNU Emacs is written in the Elisp extension language,,[27], and the set of features implemented in Elisp code are automatically present once the C core (which implements the Elisp interpreter, weighing 247 kLOC as of version 24.4) has been ported, porting Emacs to a new platform is considerably less difficult than porting an equivalent project consisting of native code only.  Theoretically, only the core must be ported to the new platform; once the core is ported, the portions implemented in the language above take minimal work to bring over.
,GNU Emacs development was relatively closed until 1999 and was used as an example of the ,Cathedral, development style in ,The Cathedral and the Bazaar,. The project has since adopted a public development mailing list and anonymous ,CVS, access. Development took place in a single CVS trunk until 2008 and was then switched to the Bazaar ,DVCS,. On November 11, 2014, development was moved to ,Git,.,[28],
,Richard Stallman has remained the principal maintainer of GNU Emacs, but he has stepped back from the role at times. Stefan Monnier and Chong Yidong were maintainers from 2008-2015.,[29],[30], John Wiegley was named maintainer in 2015 after a meeting with Stallman at MIT.,[31], As of early 2014, GNU Emacs has had 579 individual ,committers, throughout its history.,[32],
,
,XEmacs,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,XEmacs,
,  ,XEmacs, 21.5 on ,GNU,/,Linux,
,Lucid Emacs, based on an early alpha version of GNU Emacs 19, was developed beginning in 1991 by ,Jamie Zawinski, and others at ,Lucid Inc., One of the best-known early forks in ,free software, development occurred when the codebases of the two Emacs versions diverged and the separate development teams ceased efforts to merge them back into a single program.,[33], Lucid Emacs has since been renamed ,XEmacs, and remains the second most popular variety of Emacs, after GNU Emacs.,[,citation needed,], XEmacs development has slowed, with the most recent stable version 21.4.22 released in January 2009 (while a beta was released in 2013), while GNU Emacs has implemented many formerly XEmacs-only features. This has led some users to proclaim XEmacs' death.,[34],
,
,Other forks of GNU Emacs,[,edit,],
,Other forks, less known than XEmacs, include:
,
,Remacs – a port of GNU Emacs to the ,Rust, programming language.,[35],
,Meadow, – a Japanese version for Microsoft Windows,[36],
,SXEmacs, – Steve Youngs' fork of XEmacs,[37],
,Aquamacs, – based on GNU Emacs (Aquamacs 3.2 is based on GNU Emacs version 24 and Aquamacs 3.3 is based on GNU Emacs version 25) which focuses on integrating with the Apple Macintosh user interface,
,Various Emacs editors,[,edit,],
,  ,The ,mg, tiny Emacs-like editor in ,OpenBSD, 5.3. Editing ,Ruby, ,source code,
,  ,Zmacs,, an Emacs for ,Lisp machines,
,In the past, projects aimed at producing small versions of Emacs proliferated. GNU Emacs was initially targeted at computers with a 32-bit flat address space and at least 1 ,MiB, of RAM.  Such computers were high end ,workstations, and ,minicomputers, in the 1980s, and this left a need for smaller reimplementations that would run on common ,personal computer, hardware.  In more recent times, small clones have been designed to fit on software installation disks.,[,citation needed,],
,Other projects aim to implement Emacs in a different dialect of Lisp or a different programming language altogether.  Although not all are still actively maintained, these clones include:
,
,MicroEMACS,, which was originally written by Dave Conroy and further developed by Daniel Lawrence and which exists in many variations.,
,mg,, originally called MicroGNUEmacs and, later, mg2a, a public-domain offshoot of MicroEMACS intended to more closely resemble GNU Emacs. Now installed by default on ,OpenBSD,.,
,NotGNU,,[38], a small, fast, proprietary ,freeware, implementation for DOS, Win16, Win32 and Linux by Julie Melbin.,
,JOVE, (Jonathan's Own Version of Emacs), Jonathan Payne's non-programmable Emacs implementation for ,UNIX-like, systems.,
,MINCE, (MINCE Is Not Complete Emacs), a version for CP/M and later DOS, from ,Mark of the Unicorn,. MINCE evolved into Final Word, which eventually became the Borland ,Sprint, word processor.,
,Perfect Writer,, a ,CP/M, implementation derived from MINCE that was included circa 1982 as the default word processor with the very earliest releases of the Kaypro II and Kaypro IV. It was later provided with the Kaypro 10 as an alternative to ,WordStar,.,
,Freemacs,, a ,DOS, version that uses an extension language based on text macro expansion and fits within the original 64 ,KiB, flat memory limit.,
,Zile,. Zile was a recursive acronym for ,Z,ile ,I,s ,L,ossy, ,E,macs,,,[39], but the project was rewritten in ,Lua, and now gives the expansion as Zile Implements Lua Editors. The new Zile still includes an implementation of Emacs in Lua called Zemacs. There is also an implementation of vi called Zi.,
,Zmacs,, for the MIT ,Lisp Machine, and its descendants, implemented in ,ZetaLisp,.,
,Climacs,, a Zmacs-influenced variant implemented in ,Common Lisp,.,
,QEmacs,,,[40], a small editor by ,Fabrice Bellard, with UTF-8 capability that can quickly edit files as large as hundreds of MiB in size.,
,Epsilon,,,[41], an Emacs clone by Lugaru Software. Versions for DOS, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X and O/S 2 are bundled in the release. It uses a non-Lisp extension language with C syntax and used a very early concurrent command shell buffer implementation under the single-tasking MS-DOS.,
,PceEmacs, is the Emacs-based editor for ,SWI-Prolog,.,
,EmACT,, a 1986 fork of MicroEmacs by Christian Jullien. EmACT,[42], source code is available at SourceForge.,
,Amacs,, an Apple II ProDOS version of Emacs implemented in 6502 assembly by ,Brian Fox,.,[43],[44],
,Hemlock,, originally written in ,Spice Lisp,, then ,Common Lisp,. A part of ,CMU Common Lisp,. Influenced by ,Zmacs,. Later forked by Lucid Common Lisp (as Helix), ,LispWorks, and ,Clozure CL, projects. There is also a Portable Hemlock project, which aims to provide a Hemlock, which runs on several Common Lisp implementations.,
,umacs,,,[45], an implementation under ,OS-9,

,Epsilon (text editor), Defaults to Emacs emulation and supports a vi mode.,
,The ,Cocoa text system, uses some of the same terminology and understands many Emacs navigation bindings. This is possible because the native UI uses the ,Command key, (equivalent to Super) instead of the ,Control key,.,[46],
,Sublime Text, can emulate some of Emacs' behavior with the SublemacsPro plugin.,[47],
,Visual Studio Emacs Keys, provides a set of Emacs keybindings for Visual Studio users,
,GNU Readline, is a ,line editor, that understands the standard Emacs navigation keybindings. It also has a ,vi, emulation mode.,
,GNOME Builder, has an emulation mode for Emacs.,
,Features,[,edit,],
,Emacs is primarily a ,text editor, and is designed for manipulating pieces of text, although it is capable of formatting and printing documents like a ,word processor, by interfacing with external programs such as ,LaTeX,, ,Ghostscript, or a web browser. Emacs provides commands to manipulate and ,differentially display, ,semantic, units of text such as ,words,, ,sentences,, ,paragraphs, and ,source code, constructs such as ,functions,. It also features ,keyboard macros, for performing user-defined batches of editing commands.
,GNU Emacs is a ,real-time display, editor, as its edits are displayed onscreen as they occur. This is standard behavior for modern text editors but EMACS was among the earliest to implement this functionality instead of having to issue a separate command to insert new edits into the existing text as in vi.
,
,General architecture,[,edit,],
,Almost all of the functionality in Emacs, including basic editing operations such as the insertion of characters into a document, is achieved through ,functions, written in ,Emacs Lisp, (ELisp), a dialect of the ,Lisp programming language,. The ELisp layer sits atop a stable core of basic services and platform abstraction written in the ,C programming language,. In this Lisp environment, ,variables, and ,functions, can be modified with no need to recompile or restart Emacs.
,Emacs operates on ,data structures, called ,buffers, containing text with additional attributes; every buffer maintains its own ,point, (cursor location) and ,mark, (another location, delimiting the selected ,region, together with the ,point,), the name of the file it is ,visiting, (if applicable) and the set of active ,modes, (exactly one ,major mode,[,clarification needed,], and any number of ,minor modes,[,clarification needed,],), which control editor behaviour through variables. Elisp code can be executed interactively through named ,commands,, which can be bound to key presses or accessed by name; some commands evaluate arbitrary Elisp code from buffers (e.g. ,eval-region, or ,eval-buffer,).
,Buffers are displayed in ,windows,, which are tiled portions of the terminal screen or the GUI window (called a ,frame, in Emacs terms; multiple frames are possible). Unless configured otherwise, windows include scroll bars, line numbers, a ,header line, at the top (usually displaying the buffer title or filename) and a ,mode line, at the bottom (usually listing the active modes and point position of the buffer).
,Multiple windows can be opened onto the same buffer, for example to see different parts of a long text, and multiple buffers can share the same text, for example to take advantage of different major modes in a mixed-language file. The mode can also be changed manually as needed with ,M-x <mode name>,.
,
,Customizability,[,edit,],
,Keystrokes can be recorded into macros and replayed to automate complex, repetitive tasks. This is often done on an ad-hoc basis, with each macro discarded after use, although macros can be saved and invoked later.,
,At startup, Emacs executes an Emacs Lisp script named ,~/.emacs, (recent versions also look for ,~/emacs.el, and ,~/.emacs.d/init.el,;,[48], Emacs will execute the first one it finds, ignoring the rest). This personal customization file can be arbitrarily long and complex, but typical content includes:
,Setting global variables or invoking functions to customize Emacs behaviour, for example ,(set-default-coding-systems 'utf-8),
,Key bindings, to override standard ones and to add shortcuts for commands that the user finds convenient but don't have a key binding by default. Example: ,(global-set-key (kbd ""C-x C-b"") 'ibuffer),
,Loading, enabling and initializing extensions (Emacs comes with many extensions, but only a few are loaded by default.),
,Configuring ,event hooks, to run arbitrary code at specific times, for example to automatically recompile source code after saving a buffer (,after-save-hook,),
,Executing arbitrary files, usually to split an overly long configuration file into manageable and homogeneous parts (,~/.emacs.d/, and ,~/elisp/, are traditional locations for these personal scripts),
,The ,customize, extension allows the user to set configuration properties such as the color scheme interactively, from within Emacs, in a more user-friendly way than by setting variables in ,.emacs,: it offers search, descriptions and help text, multiple choice inputs, reverting to defaults, modification of the running Emacs instance without reloading, and other conveniences similar to the ,preferences, functionality of other programs. The customized values are saved in ,.emacs, (or another designated file) automatically.,
,Themes,, affecting the choice of fonts and colours, are defined as elisp files and chosen through the customize extension.,
,Self-documenting,[,edit,],
,The first Emacs contained a ,help, library that included documentation for every command, variable and internal function. Because of this, Emacs proponents described the software as ,self-documenting, in that it presents the user with information on its normal features and its current state. Each function includes a documentation string that is displayed to the user on request, a practice that subsequently spread to programming languages including ,Lisp,, ,Java,, ,Perl,, and ,Python,. This help system can take users to the actual code for each function, whether from a built-in library or an added third-party library.
,Emacs also has a built-in ,tutorial,. Emacs displays instructions for performing simple editing commands and invoking the tutorial when it is launched with no file to edit. The tutorial is by Stuart Cracraft and Richard Stallman.
,
,Culture,[,edit,],
,Church of Emacs,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Editor war,
,  ,Richard Stallman, as St I,GNUcius,, a saint in the ,Church of Emacs,
,The ,Church of Emacs,, formed by ,Richard Stallman,, is a ,parody religion, created for Emacs users.,[49], While it refers to ,vi, as the ,editor of the beast, (vi-vi-vi being ,6-6-6, in Roman numerals), it does not oppose the use of vi; rather, it calls ,proprietary software, ,anathema,. (""Using a ,free, version of vi is not a sin but a ,penance,."",[50],) The Church of Emacs has its own ,newsgroup,, ,alt.religion.emacs,,,[51], that has posts purporting to support this parody religion. Supporters of vi have created an opposing ,Cult of vi,.
,Stallman has jokingly referred to himself as ,St I ,GNU, cius,, a saint in the Church of Emacs.,[52],
,
,Emacs pinky,[,edit,],
,There is folklore attributing a ,repetitive strain injury, colloquially called ,Emacs ,pinky, to Emacs' strong dependence on modifier keys,,[53], although there have not been any studies done to show Emacs causes more such problems than other keyboard-heavy computer programs.
,Users have addressed this through various approaches. Some users recommend simply using the two Control keys on typical PC keyboards like Shift keys while touch typing to avoid overly straining the left pinky.,[54], Software-side methods include:,[55],
,
,Customizing the key layout so that the Control key is transposed with the caps lock key.,[56], Similar techniques include defining the caps lock key as an additional Control key or transposing the Control and Meta keys.,This technique has also been specifically recommended ,against, as ,contributing, to Emacs pinky.,[,clarification needed,],
,Software, such as xwrits or the built-in ,type-break-mode, in Emacs, that reminds the user to take regularly scheduled breaks.,
,Using the ErgoEmacs keybindings (with minor mode ,ergoemacs-mode,).,[57],[58],
,Customizing the whole keyboard layout to move statistically frequent Emacs keys to more appropriate places.,[59],
,Packages such as ,ace-jump-mode,[60], or elisp extensions that provide similar functionality of tiered navigation, first asking for a character then replacing occurrences of the character with access keys for cursor movement.,
,evil-mode,, an advanced ,Vim, emulation layer.,
,god-mode,, which provides an approach similar to vim's with a mode for entering Emacs commands without modifier keys.,
,Using customized key layout offered by ,Spacemacs,, a project where ,Space, key is used as the main key for initiating control sequences. The project also heavily incorporates both ,evil-mode, and ,god-mode,.,[61],
,StickyKeys,, which turns key sequences into key combinations.,[62],
,Emacs' built-in ,viper-mode, that allows use of the ,vi, key layout for basic text editing and the Emacs scheme for more advanced features.,[63],
,Giving a dual role to a more-comfortably accessed key such as the ,Space bar, so that it functions as a Control key when pressed in combination with other keys. ,Ergonomic keyboards, or keyboards with a greater number of keys adjacent to the space bar, such as ,Japanese keyboards,, allow thumb control of other modifier keys too like Meta or Shift.,[64],
,Using a limited ergonomic subset of keybindings, and accessing other functionality by typing ,M-x <command-name>,. M-x itself can also be rebound.,
,Driving Emacs through voice input.,
,Hardware solutions include special keyboards such as ,Kinesis's Contoured Keyboard,, which places the modifier keys where they can easily be operated by the ,thumb,, or the ,Microsoft Natural keyboard,, whose large modifier keys are placed symmetrically on both sides of the keyboard and can be pressed with the palm of the hand.,[53], Foot pedals can also be used.
,The ,Emacs pinky, is a relatively recent development. The ,Space-cadet keyboard, on which Emacs was developed had oversized Control keys that were adjacent to the space bar and were easy to reach with the thumb.,[65],
,
,Terminology,[,edit,],
,The word ,emacs, is sometimes pluralized as ,emacsen,, by phonetic analogy with ,boxen, and ,VAXen,, referring to different varieties of Emacs.,[66],
,
,Emacs in popular culture,[,edit,],
,In the movie, ,The Internship (2013),, at 01:21:01, Nick Campbell asks, ""It occurred to me, why not use Emacs rather than vi as the default editor for Ubuntu?"" to which Dana replies, ""That's actually a very good thought, Nick."",[67],
,On the television series, ,Silicon Valley Season 3, episode 6,, Richard asks, ""I mean, why not just use Vim over Emacs?"", to which Winnie replies, ""I do use Vim over Emacs."", to which Richard responds, ""Oh, God, help us!"",[68],

,值得一提的是，BDFL与另一个用来指开源运动领导人的称呼“仁慈的独裁者”（benevolent dictator）的含义并不一致。后者因,埃里克·雷蒙,的《,开拓智域,》（Homesteading the Noosphere）一文而广为人知。雷蒙在文中提到，开源软件运动的本质会促使“独裁者”保持仁慈，否则巨大的分歧会导致项目被,复刻,并由新的领导所掌管。,[4],

,Game theory, is the study of ,mathematical models, of strategic interaction between rational decision-makers.,[1], It has applications in all fields of ,social science,, as well as in ,logic, and ,computer science,. Originally, it addressed ,zero-sum games,, in which one person's gains result in losses for the other participants. Today, game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations, and is now an ,umbrella term, for the science of logical decision making in humans, animals, and computers.
,Modern game theory began with the idea regarding the existence of mixed-strategy equilibria in two-person ,zero-sum games, and its proof by ,John von Neumann,. Von Neumann's original proof used the ,Brouwer fixed-point theorem, on continuous mappings into compact ,convex sets,, which became a standard method in game theory and ,mathematical economics,. His paper was followed by the 1944 book ,Theory of Games and Economic Behavior,, co-written with ,Oskar Morgenstern,, which considered ,cooperative games, of several players. The second edition of this book provided an axiomatic theory of expected utility, which allowed mathematical statisticians and economists to treat decision-making under uncertainty.
,Game theory was developed extensively in the 1950s by many scholars. It was later explicitly applied to biology in the 1970s, although similar developments go back at least as far as the 1930s. Game theory has been widely recognized as an important tool in many fields. As of  2014,[update],, with the ,Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, going to game theorist ,Jean Tirole,, eleven game theorists have won the economics Nobel Prize. ,John Maynard Smith, was awarded the ,Crafoord Prize, for his application of game theory to biology.

,History,[,edit,],
,  ,John von Neumann,
,  ,John Nash,
,Early discussions of examples of two-person games occurred long before the rise of modern, mathematical game theory. The first known discussion of game theory occurred in a letter written by Charles Waldegrave, an active Jacobite, and uncle to ,James Waldegrave,, a British diplomat, in 1713.,[2], In this letter, Waldegrave provides a ,minimax, ,mixed strategy, solution to a two-person version of the card game ,le Her,, and the problem is now known as ,Waldegrave problem,. ,James Madison, made what is now recognized as a game-theoretic analysis of the ways states can be expected to behave under different systems of taxation.,[3],[4], In his 1838 ,Recherches sur les principes mathématiques de la théorie des richesses, (,Researches into the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth,), ,Antoine Augustin Cournot, considered a ,duopoly, and presents a solution that is a restricted version of the ,Nash equilibrium,.
,In 1913, ,Ernst Zermelo, published ,Über eine Anwendung der Mengenlehre auf die Theorie des Schachspiels, (,On an Application of Set Theory to the Theory of the Game of Chess,). It proved that the optimal chess strategy is ,strictly determined,. This paved the way for more general theorems.,[5],:,429,
,In 1938, the Danish mathematical economist ,Frederik Zeuthen, proved that the mathematical model had a winning strategy by using ,Brouwer's fixed point theorem,.,[6], In his 1938 book ,Applications aux Jeux de Hasard, and earlier notes, ,Émile Borel, proved a minimax theorem for two-person zero-sum matrix games only when the pay-off matrix was symmetric. Borel conjectured that non-existence of mixed-strategy equilibria in two-person zero-sum games would occur, a conjecture that was proved false.
,Game theory did not really exist as a unique field until ,John von Neumann, published the paper ,On the Theory of Games of Strategy,  in 1928.,[7], Von Neumann's original proof used ,Brouwer's fixed-point theorem, on continuous mappings into compact convex sets, which became a standard method in game theory and ,mathematical economics,. His paper was followed by his 1944 book ,Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, co-authored with ,Oskar Morgenstern,.,[8], The second edition of this book provided an axiomatic theory of utility, which reincarnated Daniel Bernoulli's old theory of utility (of the money) as an independent discipline. Von Neumann's work in game theory culminated in this 1944 book. This foundational work contains the method for finding mutually consistent solutions for two-person zero-sum games. During the following time period, work on game theory was primarily focused on ,cooperative game, theory, which analyzes optimal strategies for groups of individuals, presuming that they can enforce agreements between them about proper strategies.,[9],
,In 1950, the first mathematical discussion of the ,prisoner's dilemma, appeared, and an experiment was undertaken by notable mathematicians ,Merrill M. Flood, and ,Melvin Dresher,, as part of the ,RAND Corporation,'s investigations into game theory. RAND pursued the studies because of possible applications to global ,nuclear strategy,.,[10], Around this same time, ,John Nash, developed a criterion for mutual consistency of players' strategies, known as ,Nash equilibrium,, applicable to a wider variety of games than the criterion proposed by von Neumann and Morgenstern. Nash proved that every n-player, non-zero-sum (not just 2-player zero-sum) ,non-cooperative game, has what is now known as a Nash equilibrium.
,Game theory experienced a flurry of activity in the 1950s, during which time the concepts of the ,core,, the ,extensive form game,, ,fictitious play,, ,repeated games,, and the ,Shapley value, were developed. In addition, the first applications of game theory to ,philosophy, and ,political science, occurred during this time.
,In 1979 ,Robert Axelrod, tried setting up computer programs as players and found that in tournaments between them the winner was often a simple ""tit-for-tat"" program that cooperates on the first step, then on subsequent steps just does whatever its opponent did on the previous step. The same winner was also often obtained by natural selection; a fact widely taken to explain cooperation phenomena in evolutionary biology and the social sciences.,[11],
,
,Prize-winning achievements,[,edit,],
,In 1965, ,Reinhard Selten, introduced his ,solution concept, of ,subgame perfect equilibria,, which further refined the Nash equilibrium (later he would introduce ,trembling hand perfection, as well). In 1994 Nash, Selten and ,Harsanyi, became ,Economics Nobel Laureates, for their contributions to economic game theory.
,In the 1970s, game theory was extensively applied in ,biology,, largely as a result of the work of ,John Maynard Smith, and his ,evolutionarily stable strategy,. In addition, the concepts of ,correlated equilibrium,, trembling hand perfection, and ,common knowledge,[12], were introduced and analyzed.
,In 2005, game theorists ,Thomas Schelling, and ,Robert Aumann, followed Nash, Selten and Harsanyi as Nobel Laureates. Schelling worked on dynamic models, early examples of ,evolutionary game theory,. Aumann contributed more to the equilibrium school, introducing an equilibrium coarsening, correlated equilibrium, and developing an extensive formal analysis of the assumption of common knowledge and of its consequences.
,In 2007, ,Leonid Hurwicz,, together with ,Eric Maskin, and ,Roger Myerson,, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics ""for having laid the foundations of ,mechanism design, theory"". Myerson's contributions include the notion of ,proper equilibrium,, and an important graduate text: ,Game Theory, Analysis of Conflict,.,[1], Hurwicz introduced and formalized the concept of ,incentive compatibility,.
,In 2012, ,Alvin E. Roth, and ,Lloyd S. Shapley, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics ""for the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design"" and, in 2014, the ,Nobel, went to game theorist ,Jean Tirole,.
,
,Game types,[,edit,],
,Cooperative / Non-cooperative,[,edit,],
,Main articles: ,Cooperative game, and ,Non-cooperative game,
,A game is ,cooperative, if the players are able to form binding commitments externally enforced (e.g. through ,contract law,). A game is ,non-cooperative, if players cannot form alliances or if all agreements need to be ,self-enforcing, (e.g. through ,credible threats,).,[1],
,Cooperative games are often analysed through the framework of ,cooperative game theory,,, which focuses on predicting which coalitions will form, the joint actions that groups take and the resulting collective payoffs. It is opposed to the traditional ,non-cooperative game theory, which focuses on predicting individual players' actions and payoffs and analyzing ,Nash equilibria,.,[2],[3],
,Cooperative game theory provides a high-level approach as it only describes the structure, strategies and payoffs of coalitions, whereas non-cooperative game theory also looks at how bargaining procedures will affect the distribution of payoffs within each coalition. As non-cooperative game theory is more general, cooperative games can be analyzed through the approach of non-cooperative game theory (the converse does not hold) provided that sufficient assumptions are made to encompass all the possible strategies available to players due to the possibility of external enforcement of cooperation. While it would thus be optimal to have all games expressed under a non-cooperative framework, in many instances insufficient information is available to accurately model the formal procedures available to the players during the strategic bargaining process, or the resulting model would be of too high complexity to offer a practical tool in the real world. In such cases, cooperative game theory provides a simplified approach that allows analysis of the game at large without having to make any assumption about bargaining powers.

,An asymmetric game,
,
,Main article: ,Symmetric game,
,A symmetric game is a game where the payoffs for playing a particular strategy depend only on the other strategies employed, not on who is playing them. If the identities of the players can be changed without changing the payoff to the strategies, then a game is symmetric. Many of the commonly studied 2×2 games are symmetric. The standard representations of ,chicken,, the ,prisoner's dilemma,, and the ,stag hunt, are all symmetric games. Some,[,who?,], scholars would consider certain asymmetric games as examples of these games as well. However, the most common payoffs for each of these games are symmetric.
,Most commonly studied asymmetric games are games where there are not identical strategy sets for both players. For instance, the ,ultimatum game, and similarly the ,dictator game, have different strategies for each player. It is possible, however, for a game to have identical strategies for both players, yet be asymmetric. For example, the game pictured to the right is asymmetric despite having identical strategy sets for both players.

,A zero-sum game,
,
,Main article: ,Zero-sum game,
,Zero-sum games are a special case of constant-sum games, in which choices by players can neither increase nor decrease the available resources. In zero-sum games the total benefit to all players in the game, for every combination of strategies, always adds to zero (more informally, a player benefits only at the equal expense of others).,[13], ,Poker, exemplifies a zero-sum game (ignoring the possibility of the house's cut), because one wins exactly the amount one's opponents lose. Other zero-sum games include ,matching pennies, and most classical board games including ,Go, and ,chess,.
,Many games studied by game theorists (including the famed ,prisoner's dilemma,) are non-zero-sum games, because the ,outcome, has net results greater or less than zero. Informally, in non-zero-sum games, a gain by one player does not necessarily correspond with a loss by another.
,Constant-sum games correspond to activities like theft and gambling, but not to the fundamental economic situation in which there are potential ,gains from trade,. It is possible to transform any game into a (possibly asymmetric) zero-sum game by adding a dummy player (often called ""the board"") whose losses compensate the players' net winnings.
,
,Simultaneous / Sequential,[,edit,],
,Main articles: ,Simultaneous game, and ,Sequential game,
,Simultaneous games, are games where both players move simultaneously, or if they do not move simultaneously, the later players are unaware of the earlier players' actions (making them ,effectively, simultaneous). ,Sequential games, (or dynamic games) are games where later players have some knowledge about earlier actions. This need not be ,perfect information, about every action of earlier players; it might be very little knowledge. For instance, a player may know that an earlier player did not perform one particular action, while s/he does not know which of the other available actions the first player actually performed.
,The difference between simultaneous and sequential games is captured in the different representations discussed above. Often, ,normal form, is used to represent simultaneous games, while ,extensive form, is used to represent sequential ones. The transformation of extensive to normal form is one way, meaning that multiple extensive form games correspond to the same normal form. Consequently, notions of equilibrium for simultaneous games are insufficient for reasoning about sequential games; see ,subgame perfection,.
,In short, the differences between sequential and simultaneous games are as follows:

,
,Perfect information and imperfect information,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Perfect information,
,  ,A game of imperfect information (the dotted line represents ignorance on the part of player 2, formally called an ,information set,),
,An important subset of sequential games consists of games of ,perfect information,. A game is one of perfect information if all players know the moves previously made by all other players. Most games studied in game theory are imperfect-information games.,[,citation needed,], Examples of perfect-information games include ,tic-tac-toe,, ,checkers,, ,infinite chess,, and ,Go,.,[14],[15],[16],[17],
,Many card games are games of imperfect information, such as ,poker, and ,bridge,.,[18], Perfect information is often confused with ,complete information,, which is a similar concept.,[,citation needed,], Complete information requires that every player know the strategies and payoffs available to the other players but not necessarily the actions taken. Games of incomplete information can be reduced, however, to games of imperfect information by introducing "",moves by nature,"".,[19],
,
,Combinatorial games,[,edit,],
,Games in which the difficulty of finding an optimal strategy stems from the multiplicity of possible moves are called combinatorial games. Examples include chess and go. Games that involve ,imperfect information, may also have a strong combinatorial character, for instance ,backgammon,. There is no unified theory addressing combinatorial elements in games. There are, however, mathematical tools that can solve particular problems and answer general questions.,[20],
,Games of ,perfect information, have been studied in ,combinatorial game theory,, which has developed novel representations, e.g. ,surreal numbers,, as well as ,combinatorial, and ,algebraic, (and ,sometimes non-constructive,) proof methods to ,solve games, of certain types, including ""loopy"" games that may result in infinitely long sequences of moves. These methods address games with higher combinatorial complexity than those usually considered in traditional (or ""economic"") game theory.,[21],[22], A typical game that has been solved this way is ,hex,. A related field of study, drawing from ,computational complexity theory,, is ,game complexity,, which is concerned with estimating the computational difficulty of finding optimal strategies.,[23],
,Research in ,artificial intelligence, has addressed both perfect and imperfect information games that have very complex combinatorial structures (like chess, go, or backgammon) for which no provable optimal strategies have been found. The practical solutions involve computational heuristics, like ,alpha-beta pruning, or use of ,artificial neural networks, trained by ,reinforcement learning,, which make games more tractable in computing practice.,[20],[24],
,
,Infinitely long games,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Determinacy,
,Games, as studied by economists and real-world game players, are generally finished in finitely many moves. Pure mathematicians are not so constrained, and ,set theorists, in particular study games that last for infinitely many moves, with the winner (or other payoff) not known until ,after, all those moves are completed.
,The focus of attention is usually not so much on the best way to play such a game, but whether one player has a ,winning strategy,. (It can be proven, using the ,axiom of choice,, that there are games – even with perfect information and where the only outcomes are ""win"" or ""lose"" – for which ,neither, player has a winning strategy.) The existence of such strategies, for cleverly designed games, has important consequences in ,descriptive set theory,.
,
,Discrete and continuous games,[,edit,],
,Much of game theory is concerned with finite, discrete games, that have a finite number of players, moves, events, outcomes, etc. Many concepts can be extended, however. ,Continuous games, allow players to choose a strategy from a continuous strategy set. For instance, ,Cournot competition, is typically modeled with players' strategies being any non-negative quantities, including fractional quantities.
,
,Differential games,[,edit,],
,Differential games, such as the continuous ,pursuit and evasion game, are continuous games where the evolution of the players' state variables is governed by ,differential equations,. The problem of finding an optimal strategy in a differential game is closely related to the ,optimal control, theory. In particular, there are two types of strategies: the open-loop strategies are found using the ,Pontryagin maximum principle, while the closed-loop strategies are found using ,Bellman's Dynamic Programming, method.
,A particular case of differential games are the games with a random ,time horizon,.,[25], In such games, the terminal time is a random variable with a given ,probability distribution, function. Therefore, the players maximize the ,mathematical expectation, of the cost function. It was shown that the modified optimization problem can be reformulated as a discounted differential game over an infinite time interval.
,
,Evolutionary game theory,[,edit,],
,Evolutionary game theory, studies players who adjust their strategies over time according to rules that are not necessarily rational or farsighted.,[26],  In general, the evolution of strategies over time according to such rules is modeled as a ,Markov chain, with a state variable such as the current strategy profile or how the game has been played in the recent past. Such rules may feature imitation, optimization or survival of the fittest.
,In biology, such models can represent (biological) ,evolution,, in which offspring adopt their parents' strategies and parents who play more successful strategies (i.e. corresponding to higher payoffs) have a greater number of offspring. In the social sciences, such models typically represent strategic adjustment by players who play a game many times within their lifetime and, consciously or unconsciously, occasionally adjust their strategies.,[27],
,
,Stochastic outcomes (and relation to other fields),[,edit,],
,Individual decision problems with stochastic outcomes are sometimes considered ""one-player games"". These situations are not considered game theoretical by some authors.,[,by whom?,], They may be modeled using similar tools within the related disciplines of ,decision theory,, ,operations research,, and areas of ,artificial intelligence,, particularly ,AI planning, (with uncertainty) and ,multi-agent system,. Although these fields may have different motivators, the mathematics involved are substantially the same, e.g. using ,Markov decision processes, (MDP).,[,citation needed,],
,Stochastic outcomes can also be modeled in terms of game theory by adding a randomly acting player who makes ""chance moves"" ("",moves by nature,"").,[28], This player is not typically considered a third player in what is otherwise a two-player game, but merely serves to provide a roll of the dice where required by the game.
,For some problems, different approaches to modeling stochastic outcomes may lead to different solutions. For example, the difference in approach between MDPs and the ,minimax solution, is that the latter considers the worst-case over a set of adversarial moves, rather than reasoning in expectation about these moves given a fixed probability distribution. The minimax approach may be advantageous where stochastic models of uncertainty are not available, but may also be overestimating extremely unlikely (but costly) events, dramatically swaying the strategy in such scenarios if it is assumed that an adversary can force such an event to happen.,[29], (See ,Black swan theory, for more discussion on this kind of modeling issue, particularly as it relates to predicting and limiting losses in investment banking.)
,General models that include all elements of stochastic outcomes, adversaries, and partial or noisy observability (of moves by other players) have also been studied. The "",gold standard,"" is considered to be partially observable ,stochastic game, (POSG), but few realistic problems are computationally feasible in POSG representation.,[29],
,
,Metagames,[,edit,],
,These are games the play of which is the development of the rules for another game, the target or subject game. ,Metagames, seek to maximize the utility value of the rule set developed. The theory of metagames is related to ,mechanism design, theory.
,The term ,metagame analysis, is also used to refer to a practical approach developed by Nigel Howard.,[30], whereby a situation is framed as a strategic game in which stakeholders try to realise their objectives by means of the options available to them. Subsequent developments have led to the formulation of ,confrontation analysis,.
,
,Pooling games,[,edit,],
,These are games prevailing over all forms of society. Pooling games are repeated plays with changing payoff table in general over an experienced path and their equilibrium strategies usually take a form of evolutionary social convention and economic convention. Pooling game theory emerges to formally recognize the interaction between optimal choice in one play and the emergence of forthcoming payoff table update path, identify the invariance existence and robustness, and predict variance over time. The theory is based upon topological transformation classification of payoff table update over time to predict variance and invariance, and is also within the jurisdiction of the computational law of reachable optimality for ordered system.,[31],
,
,Mean field game theory,[,edit,],
,Mean field game theory, is the study of strategic decision making in very large populations of small interacting agents. This class of problems was considered in the economics literature by ,Boyan Jovanovic, and ,Robert W. Rosenthal,, in the engineering literature by ,Peter E. Caines, and by mathematician ,Pierre-Louis Lions, and Jean-Michel Lasry.
,
,Representation of games,[,edit,],
,See also: ,List of games in game theory,
,The games studied in game theory are well-defined mathematical objects. To be fully defined, a game must specify the following elements: the ,players, of the game,, the ,information, and ,actions, available to each player at each decision point, and the ,payoffs, for each outcome. (Eric Rasmusen refers to these four ""essential elements"" by the acronym ""PAPI"".),[32], A game theorist typically uses these elements, along with a ,solution concept, of their choosing, to deduce a set of equilibrium ,strategies, for each player such that, when these strategies are employed, no player can profit by unilaterally deviating from their strategy. These equilibrium strategies determine an ,equilibrium, to the game—a stable state in which either one outcome occurs or a set of outcomes occur with known probability.
,Most cooperative games are presented in the characteristic function form, while the extensive and the normal forms are used to define noncooperative games.
,
,Extensive form,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Extensive form game,
,  ,An extensive form game,
,The extensive form can be used to formalize games with a time sequencing of moves. Games here are played on ,trees, (as pictured here). Here each ,vertex, (or node) represents a point of choice for a player. The player is specified by a number listed by the vertex. The lines out of the vertex represent a possible action for that player. The payoffs are specified at the bottom of the tree. The extensive form can be viewed as a multi-player generalization of a ,decision tree,.,[33], To solve any extensive form game, ,backward induction, must be used. It involves working backward up the game tree to determine what a rational player would do at the last vertex of the tree, what the player with the previous move would do given that the player with the last move is rational, and so on until the first vertex of the tree is reached.,[34],
,The game pictured consists of two players.  The way this particular game is structured (i.e., with sequential decision making and perfect information), ,Player 1, ""moves"" first by choosing either ,F, or ,U, (Fair or Unfair). Next in the sequence, ,Player 2,, who has now seen ,Player 1,',s move, chooses to play either ,A, or ,R,. Once ,Player 2, has made his/ her choice, the game is considered finished and each player gets their respective payoff.  Suppose that ,Player 1, chooses ,U, and then ,Player 2, chooses ,A,: ,Player 1, then gets a payoff of ""eight"" (which in real-world terms can be interpreted in many ways, the simplest of which is in terms of money but could mean things such as eight days of vacation or eight countries conquered or even eight more opportunities to play the same game against other players) and ,Player 2, gets a payoff of ""two"".
,The extensive form can also capture simultaneous-move games and games with imperfect information. To represent it, either a dotted line connects different vertices to represent them as being part of the same information set (i.e. the players do not know at which point they are), or a closed line is drawn around them. (See example in the ,imperfect information section,.)

,Normal form or payoff matrix of a 2-player, 2-strategy game,
,
,Main article: ,Normal-form game,
,The normal (or strategic form) game is usually represented by a ,matrix, which shows the players, strategies, and payoffs (see the example to the right). More generally it can be represented by any function that associates a payoff for each player with every possible combination of actions. In the accompanying example there are two players; one chooses the row and the other chooses the column. Each player has two strategies, which are specified by the number of rows and the number of columns. The payoffs are provided in the interior. The first number is the payoff received by the row player (Player 1 in our example); the second is the payoff for the column player (Player 2 in our example). Suppose that Player 1 plays ,Up, and that Player 2 plays ,Left,. Then Player 1 gets a payoff of 4, and Player 2 gets 3.
,When a game is presented in normal form, it is presumed that each player acts simultaneously or, at least, without knowing the actions of the other. If players have some information about the choices of other players, the game is usually presented in extensive form.
,Every extensive-form game has an equivalent normal-form game, however the transformation to normal form may result in an exponential blowup in the size of the representation, making it computationally impractical.,[35],
,
,Characteristic function form,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Cooperative game,
,In games that possess removable utility, separate rewards are not given; rather, the characteristic function decides the payoff of each unity. The idea is that the unity that is 'empty', so to speak, does not receive a reward at all.
,The origin of this form is to be found in John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern's book; when looking at these instances, they guessed that when a union ,

as if two individuals were playing a normal game. The balanced payoff of C is a basic function. Although there are differing examples that help determine coalitional amounts from normal games, not all appear that in their function form can be derived from such.

,Such characteristic functions have expanded to describe games where there is no removable utility.
,
,General and applied uses,[,edit,],
,As a method of ,applied mathematics,, game theory has been used to study a wide variety of human and animal behaviors. It was initially developed in ,economics, to understand a large collection of economic behaviors, including behaviors of firms, markets, and consumers. The first use of game-theoretic analysis was by ,Antoine Augustin Cournot, in 1838 with his solution of the ,Cournot duopoly,. The use of game theory in the social sciences has expanded, and game theory has been applied to political, sociological, and psychological behaviors as well.
,Although pre-twentieth century ,naturalists, such as ,Charles Darwin, made game-theoretic kinds of statements, the use of game-theoretic analysis in biology began with ,Ronald Fisher,'s studies of animal behavior during the 1930s. This work predates the name ""game theory"", but it shares many important features with this field. The developments in economics were later applied to biology largely by ,John Maynard Smith, in his book ,Evolution and the Theory of Games,.,[36],
,In addition to being used to describe, predict, and explain behavior, game theory has also been used to develop theories of ethical or normative behavior and to ,prescribe, such behavior.,[37], In ,economics and philosophy,, scholars have applied game theory to help in the understanding of good or proper behavior. Game-theoretic arguments of this type can be found as far back as ,Plato,.,[38], An alternative version of game theory, called ,chemical game theory,, represents the player's choices as metaphorical chemical reactant molecules called “knowlecules”.,[39],  Chemical game theory then calculates the outcomes as equilibrium solutions to a system of chemical reactions.
,
,Description and modeling,[,edit,],
,  ,A four-stage ,centipede game,
,The primary use of game theory is to describe and ,model, how human populations behave. Some,[,who?,], scholars believe that by finding the equilibria of games they can predict how actual human populations will behave when confronted with situations analogous to the game being studied. This particular view of game theory has been criticized. It is argued that the assumptions made by game theorists are often violated when applied to real-world situations. Game theorists usually assume players act rationally, but in practice, human behavior often deviates from this model. Game theorists respond by comparing their assumptions to those used in ,physics,. Thus while their assumptions do not always hold, they can treat game theory as a reasonable scientific ,ideal, akin to the models used by ,physicists,. However, empirical work has shown that in some classic games, such as the ,centipede game,, ,guess 2/3 of the average, game, and the ,dictator game,, people regularly do not play Nash equilibria. There is an ongoing debate regarding the importance of these experiments and whether the analysis of the experiments fully captures all aspects of the relevant situation.,[40],
,Some game theorists, following the work of ,John Maynard Smith, and ,George R. Price,, have turned to ,evolutionary game theory, in order to resolve these issues. These models presume either no rationality or ,bounded rationality, on the part of players. Despite the name, evolutionary game theory does not necessarily presume ,natural selection, in the biological sense. Evolutionary game theory includes both biological as well as cultural evolution and also models of individual learning (for example, ,fictitious play, dynamics).

,The ,Prisoner's Dilemma,
,
,Some scholars, like ,Leonard Savage,,,[,citation needed,], see game theory not as a predictive tool for the behavior of human beings, but as a suggestion for how people ought to behave. Since a strategy, corresponding to a ,Nash equilibrium, of a game constitutes one's ,best response, to the actions of the other players – provided they are in (the same) Nash equilibrium – playing a strategy that is part of a Nash equilibrium seems appropriate. This normative use of game theory has also come under criticism.
,
,
,Economics and business,[,edit,],
,Game theory is a major method used in ,mathematical economics, and business for ,modeling, competing behaviors of interacting ,agents,.,[41], Applications include a wide array of economic phenomena and approaches, such as ,auctions,, ,bargaining,, ,mergers & acquisitions, pricing,,[42], ,fair division,, ,duopolies,, ,oligopolies,, ,social network, formation, ,agent-based computational economics,,,[43], ,general equilibrium,, ,mechanism design,,,[44], and ,voting systems,;,[45], and across such broad areas as ,experimental economics,,,[46], ,behavioral economics,,,[47], ,information economics,,,[32], ,industrial organization,,,[48], and ,political economy,.,[49],[50],
,This research usually focuses on particular sets of strategies known as ,""solution concepts"" or ""equilibria"",. A common assumption is that players act rationally. In non-cooperative games, the most famous of these is the ,Nash equilibrium,. A set of strategies is a Nash equilibrium if each represents a best response to the other strategies. If all the players are playing the strategies in a Nash equilibrium, they have no unilateral incentive to deviate, since their strategy is the best they can do given what others are doing.,[51],[52],
,The payoffs of the game are generally taken to represent the ,utility, of individual players.
,A prototypical paper on game theory in economics begins by presenting a game that is an abstraction of a particular economic situation. One or more solution concepts are chosen, and the author demonstrates which strategy sets in the presented game are equilibria of the appropriate type. Naturally one might wonder to what use this information should be put. Economists and business professors suggest two primary uses (noted above): ,descriptive, and ,prescriptive,.,[37],
,
,Political science,[,edit,],
,The application of game theory to ,political science, is focused in the overlapping areas of ,fair division,, ,political economy,, ,public choice,, ,war bargaining,, ,positive political theory,, and ,social choice theory,. In each of these areas, researchers have developed game-theoretic models in which the players are often voters, states, special interest groups, and politicians.
,Early examples of game theory applied to political science are provided by ,Anthony Downs,. In his book ,An Economic Theory of Democracy,,,[53], he applies the ,Hotelling firm location model, to the political process. In the Downsian model, political candidates commit to ideologies on a one-dimensional policy space. Downs first shows how the political candidates will converge to the ideology preferred by the median voter if voters are fully informed, but then argues that voters choose to remain rationally ignorant which allows for candidate divergence. Game Theory was applied in 1962 to the ,Cuban missile crisis, during the presidency of John F. Kennedy.,[54],
,It has also been proposed that game theory explains the stability of any form of political government.  Taking the simplest case of a monarchy, for example, the king, being only one person, does not and cannot maintain his authority by personally exercising physical control over all or even any significant number of his subjects.  Sovereign control is instead explained by the recognition by each citizen that all other citizens expect each other to view the king (or other established government) as the person whose orders will be followed.  Coordinating communication among citizens to replace the sovereign is effectively barred, since conspiracy to replace the sovereign is generally punishable as a crime.  Thus, in a process that can be modeled by variants of the ,prisoner's dilemma,, during periods of stability no citizen will find it rational to move to replace the sovereign, even if all the citizens know they would be better off if they were all to act collectively.,[55],
,A game-theoretic explanation for ,democratic peace, is that public and open debate in democracies sends clear and reliable information regarding their intentions to other states. In contrast, it is difficult to know the intentions of nondemocratic leaders, what effect concessions will have, and if promises will be kept. Thus there will be mistrust and unwillingness to make concessions if at least one of the parties in a dispute is a non-democracy.,[56],
,On the other hand, game theory predicts that two countries may still go to war even if their leaders are cognizant of the costs of fighting. War may result from asymmetric information; two countries may have incentives to mis-represent the amount of military resources they have on hand, rendering them unable to settle disputes agreeably without resorting to fighting. Moreover, war may arise because of commitment problems: if two countries wish to settle a dispute via peaceful means, but each wishes to go back on the terms of that settlement, they may have no choice but to resort to warfare. Finally, war may result from issue indivisibilities.,[57],
,Game theory could also help predict a nation's responses when there is a new rule or law to be applied to that nation. One example would be Peter John Wood's (2013) research when he looked into what nations could do to help reduce climate change. Wood thought this could be accomplished by making treaties with other nations to reduce ,greenhouse gas, emissions. However, he concluded that this idea could not work because it would create a ,prisoner's dilemma, to the nations.,[58],

,Main article: ,Evolutionary game theory,
,Unlike those in economics, the payoffs for games in ,biology, are often interpreted as corresponding to ,fitness,. In addition, the focus has been less on ,equilibria, that correspond to a notion of rationality and more on ones that would be maintained by ,evolutionary, forces. The best-known equilibrium in biology is known as the ,evolutionarily stable strategy, (ESS), first introduced in (,Smith & Price 1973,). Although its initial motivation did not involve any of the mental requirements of the ,Nash equilibrium,, every ESS is a Nash equilibrium.
,In biology, game theory has been used as a model to understand many different phenomena. It was first used to explain the evolution (and stability) of the approximate 1:1 ,sex ratios,. (,Fisher 1930,) suggested that the 1:1 sex ratios are a result of evolutionary forces acting on individuals who could be seen as trying to maximize their number of grandchildren.
,Additionally, biologists have used ,evolutionary game theory, and the ESS to explain the emergence of ,animal communication,.,[59], The analysis of ,signaling games, and ,other communication games, has provided insight into the evolution of communication among animals. For example, the ,mobbing behavior, of many species, in which a large number of prey animals attack a larger predator, seems to be an example of spontaneous emergent organization. Ants have also been shown to exhibit feed-forward behavior akin to fashion (see ,Paul Ormerod,'s ,Butterfly Economics,).
,Biologists have used the ,game of chicken, to analyze fighting behavior and territoriality.,[60],
,According to Maynard Smith, in the preface to ,Evolution and the Theory of Games,, ""paradoxically, it has turned out that game theory is more readily applied to biology than to the field of economic behaviour for which it was originally designed"". Evolutionary game theory has been used to explain many seemingly incongruous phenomena in nature.,[61],
,One such phenomenon is known as ,biological altruism,. This is a situation in which an organism appears to act in a way that benefits other organisms and is detrimental to itself. This is distinct from traditional notions of altruism because such actions are not conscious, but appear to be evolutionary adaptations to increase overall fitness. Examples can be found in species ranging from vampire bats that regurgitate blood they have obtained from a night's hunting and give it to group members who have failed to feed, to worker bees that care for the queen bee for their entire lives and never mate, to ,vervet monkeys, that warn group members of a predator's approach, even when it endangers that individual's chance of survival.,[62], All of these actions increase the overall fitness of a group, but occur at a cost to the individual.
,Evolutionary game theory explains this altruism with the idea of ,kin selection,. Altruists discriminate between the individuals they help and favor relatives. ,Hamilton's rule, explains the evolutionary rationale behind this selection with the equation ,c < b × r,, where the cost ,c, to the altruist must be less than the benefit ,b, to the recipient multiplied by the coefficient of relatedness ,r,. The more closely related two organisms are causes the incidences of altruism to increase because they share many of the same alleles. This means that the altruistic individual, by ensuring that the alleles of its close relative are passed on through survival of its offspring, can forgo the option of having offspring itself because the same number of alleles are passed on. For example, helping a sibling (in diploid animals) has a coefficient of ½, because (on average) an individual shares ½ of the alleles in its sibling's offspring. Ensuring that enough of a sibling's offspring survive to adulthood precludes the necessity of the altruistic individual producing offspring.,[62], The coefficient values depend heavily on the scope of the playing field; for example if the choice of whom to favor includes all genetic living things, not just all relatives, we assume the discrepancy between all humans only accounts for approximately 1% of the diversity in the playing field, a coefficient that was ½ in the smaller field becomes 0.995. Similarly if it is considered that information other than that of a genetic nature (e.g. epigenetics, religion, science, etc.) persisted through time the playing field becomes larger still, and the discrepancies smaller.
,
,Computer science and logic,[,edit,],
,Game theory has come to play an increasingly important role in ,logic, and in ,computer science,. Several logical theories have a basis in ,game semantics,. In addition, computer scientists have used games to model ,interactive computations,. Also, game theory provides a theoretical basis to the field of ,multi-agent systems,.
,Separately, game theory has played a role in ,online algorithms,; in particular, the ,k-server problem,, which has in the past been referred to as ,games with moving costs, and ,request-answer games,.,[63], ,Yao's principle, is a game-theoretic technique for proving ,lower bounds, on the ,computational complexity, of ,randomized algorithms,, especially online algorithms.
,The emergence of the internet has motivated the development of algorithms for finding equilibria in games, markets, computational auctions, peer-to-peer systems, and security and information markets. ,Algorithmic game theory,[64], and within it ,algorithmic mechanism design,[65], combine computational ,algorithm design, and analysis of ,complex systems, with economic theory.,[66],

,Game theory has been put to several uses in ,philosophy,. Responding to two papers by ,W.V.O. Quine, (,1960,, ,1967,), ,Lewis (1969), used game theory to develop a philosophical account of ,convention,. In so doing, he provided the first analysis of ,common knowledge, and employed it in analyzing play in ,coordination games,. In addition, he first suggested that one can understand ,meaning, in terms of ,signaling games,. This later suggestion has been pursued by several philosophers since Lewis.,[67], Following ,Lewis (1969), game-theoretic account of conventions, Edna Ullmann-Margalit (1977) and ,Bicchieri, (2006) have developed theories of ,social norms, that define them as Nash equilibria that result from transforming a mixed-motive game into a coordination game.,[68],[69],
,Game theory has also challenged philosophers to think in terms of interactive ,epistemology,: what it means for a collective to have common beliefs or knowledge, and what are the consequences of this knowledge for the social outcomes resulting from the interactions of agents. Philosophers who have worked in this area include Bicchieri (1989, 1993),,[70],[71], ,Skyrms, (1990),,[72], and ,Stalnaker, (1999).,[73],
,In ,ethics,, some (most notably David Gauthier, Gregory Kavka, and Jean Hampton),[,who?,], authors have attempted to pursue ,Thomas Hobbes,' project of deriving morality from self-interest. Since games like the ,prisoner's dilemma, present an apparent conflict between morality and self-interest, explaining why cooperation is required by self-interest is an important component of this project. This general strategy is a component of the general ,social contract, view in ,political philosophy, (for examples, see ,Gauthier (1986), and ,Kavka (1986),).,[74],
,Other authors have attempted to use ,evolutionary game theory, in order to explain the emergence of human attitudes about morality and corresponding animal behaviors. These authors look at several games including the prisoner's dilemma, ,stag hunt,, and the ,Nash bargaining game, as providing an explanation for the emergence of attitudes about morality (see, e.g., Skyrms (,1996,, ,2004,) and Sober and Wilson (,1999,)).

,The 1959 ,military science fiction, novel ,Starship Troopers, by ,Robert A. Heinlein, mentioned ""games theory"" and ""theory of games"".,[77], In the 1997 film of the same name, the character Carl Jenkins referred to his military intelligence assignment as being assigned to ""games and theory"".,
,The 1964 film ,Dr. Strangelove, satirizes game theoretic ideas about ,deterrence theory,. For example, nuclear deterrence depends on the threat to retaliate catastrophically if a nuclear attack is detected. A game theorist might argue that such threats can fail to be ,credible,, in the sense that they can lead to ,subgame imperfect equilibria,. The movie takes this idea one step further, with the Russians irrevocably committing to a catastrophic nuclear response without making the threat public.,[,citation needed,],
,The 1980s ,power pop, band ,Game Theory, was founded by singer/songwriter ,Scott Miller,, who described the band's name as alluding to ""the study of calculating the most appropriate action given an adversary... to give yourself the minimum amount of failure."",[78],
,Liar Game,, a 2005 Japanese ,manga, and 2007 television series, presents the main characters in each episode with a game or problem that is typically drawn from game theory, as demonstrated by the strategies applied by the characters.,[,citation needed,],

,  ,Taxonomy of money, based on ""Central bank cryptocurrencies"" by Morten Linnemann Bech and Rodney Garratt,
,
,Digital currency, (,digital money,, ,electronic money, or ,electronic currency,) is a type of ,currency, available in digital form (in contrast to physical, such as ,banknotes, and ,coins,). It exhibits properties similar to physical currencies, but can allow for instantaneous transactions and borderless transfer-of-ownership. Examples include ,virtual currencies, and ,cryptocurrencies,[1], and ,central bank, issued money accounted for in a computer database (including ,digital base money,). Like traditional ,money,, these currencies may be used to buy physical ,goods, and ,services,, but may also be restricted to certain communities such as for use inside an online game,[2], or social network.,[3],
,Digital currency is a money balance recorded electronically on a ,stored-value card, or other devices. Another form of electronic money is network money, allowing the transfer of value on ,computer networks,, particularly the ,Internet,. Electronic money is also a claim on a private ,bank, or other financial institution such as ,bank deposits,.,[4],
,Digital money can either be centralized, where there is a central point of control over the money supply, or ,decentralized,, where the control over the money supply can come from various sources.

,History,
,In 1983, a research paper by ,David Chaum, introduced the idea of digital cash.,[5], In 1990, he founded ,DigiCash,, an electronic cash company, in Amsterdam to commercialize the ideas in his research.,[6], It filed for bankruptcy in 1998.,[7],[8], In 1999, Chaum left the company.
,In 1997, Coca-Cola offered buying from vending machines using mobile payments.,[9], After that ,PayPal, emerged in 1998.,[10], Other systems followed suit, such as ,e-gold,, but it faced issues because it was used by criminals and was closed by U.S Department of Justice in 2005.,[11],[6], In 2008, ,bitcoin, was introduced, which marked the start of digital currencies.,[6],
,Origins of digital currencies date back to the 1990s ,Dot-com bubble,. One of the first was ,E-gold,, founded in 1996 and backed by gold. Another known digital currency service was ,Liberty Reserve,, founded in 2006; it lets users convert dollars or euros to Liberty Reserve Dollars or Euros, and exchange them freely with one another at a 1% fee. Both services were centralized, reputed to be used for money laundering, and inevitably shut down by the U.S. government.,[12], Q coins or QQ coins, were used as a type of commodity-based digital currency on ,Tencent QQ,'s messaging platform and emerged in early 2005. Q coins were so effective in China that they were said to have had a destabilizing effect on the Chinese Yuan currency due to speculation.,[13], Recent interest in ,cryptocurrencies, has prompted renewed interest in digital currencies, with ,bitcoin,, introduced in 2008, becoming the most widely used and accepted digital currency.
,
,Comparisons,
,Digital versus virtual currency,
,According to the ,European Central Bank,'s 2015 ""Virtual currency schemes – a further analysis"" report, virtual currency is a digital representation of value, not issued by a central bank, credit institution or e-money institution, which, in some circumstances, can be used as an alternative to money.,[14], In the previous report of October 2012, the virtual currency was defined as a type of unregulated, digital money, which is issued and usually controlled by its developers, and used and accepted among the members of a specific virtual community.,[15],
,According to the ,Bank for International Settlements,' November 2015 ""Digital currencies"" report, it is an asset represented in digital form and having some monetary characteristics.,[16], Digital currency can be denominated to a sovereign currency and issued by the issuer responsible to redeem digital money for cash. In that case, digital currency represents electronic money (e-money). Digital currency denominated in its own units of value or with decentralized or automatic issuance will be considered as a virtual currency.
,As such, bitcoin is a digital currency but also a type of virtual currency. Bitcoin and its alternatives are based on cryptographic algorithms, so these kinds of virtual currencies are also called cryptocurrencies.
,
,Digital versus traditional currency,
,Most of the traditional ,money supply, is ,bank money, held on computers. This is also considered digital currency. One could argue that our increasingly cashless society means that all currencies are becoming digital, but they are not presented to us as such.,[17],
,
,Types of systems,
,Centralized systems,
,Main article: ,Electronic funds transfer,
,Currency can be exchanged electronically using ,debit cards, and ,credit cards, using ,electronic funds transfer at point of sale,.
,
,Mobile digital wallets,
,A number of electronic money systems use ,contactless payment, transfer in order to facilitate easy payment and give the payee more confidence in not letting go of their electronic wallet during the transaction.
,
,In 1994 ,Mondex, and ,National Westminster Bank, provided an ""electronic purse"" to residents of ,Swindon,
,In about 2005 ,Telefónica, and ,BBVA Bank, launched a payment system in ,Spain, called Mobipay,[18], which used simple ,short message service, facilities of ,feature phones, intended for pay-as you go services including taxis and pre-pay phone recharges via a BBVA current bank account debit.,
,In January 2010, ,Venmo, launched as a mobile payment system through SMS, which transformed into a social app where friends can pay each other for minor expenses like a cup of coffee, rent and paying your share of the restaurant bill when you forget your wallet.,[19], It is popular with college students, but has some security issues.,[20], It can be linked to your bank account, credit/debit card or have a loaded value to limit the amount of loss in case of a security breach. Credit cards and non-major debit cards incur a 3% processing fee.,[21],
,On September 19, 2011, ,Google Wallet, released in the United States to make it easy to carry all your credit/debit cards on your phone.,[22],
,In 2012 ,Ireland,'s ,O2, (owned by ,Telefónica,) launched Easytrip to pay ,road tolls, which were charged to the mobile phone account or prepay credit.,[23],
,The UK's ,O2, invented O2 Wallet,[24], at about the same time. The wallet can be charged with regular bank accounts or cards and discharged by participating retailers using a technique known as 'money messages'. The service closed in 2014.,
,On September 9, 2014, ,Apple Pay, was announced at the ,iPhone 6, event. In October 2014 it was released as an update to work on ,iPhone 6, and ,Apple Watch,. It is very similar to ,Google Wallet,, but for Apple devices only.,[25],
,Decentralized systems,
,Main article: ,Cryptocurrency,
,See also: ,List of cryptocurrencies,
,A cryptocurrency is a type of digital asset that relies on ,cryptography, for chaining together digital signatures of asset transfers, ,peer-to-peer, networking and ,decentralization,.
In some cases a ,proof-of-work, or ,proof-of-stake, scheme is used to create and manage the currency.,[26],[27],[28],[29],
,Cryptocurrencies allow electronic money systems to be decentralized. The first and most popular system is ,bitcoin,, a peer-to-peer electronic monetary system based on cryptography.
,
,Virtual currency,
,Main article: ,Virtual currency,
,A virtual currency has been defined in 2012 by the ,European Central Bank, as ""a type of unregulated, digital money, which is issued and usually controlled by its developers, and used and accepted among the members of a specific ,virtual community,"".,[15], The ,US Department of Treasury, in 2013 defined it more tersely as ""a medium of exchange that operates like a currency in some environments, but does not have all the attributes of real currency"".,[30], The key attribute a virtual currency does not have according to these definitions, is the status as legal tender.
,
,Law,
,Since 2001, the European Union has implemented the ,E-Money Directive, ""on the taking up, pursuit and prudential supervision of the business of electronic money institutions"" last amended in 2009.,[31], Doubts on the real nature of EU electronic money have arisen, since calls have been made in connection with the 2007 EU ,Payment Services Directive, in favor of merging payment institutions and electronic money institutions. Such a merger could mean that electronic money is of the same nature as ,bank money, or ,scriptural money,.
,In the United States, electronic money is governed by Article 4A of the ,Uniform Commercial Code, for wholesale transactions and the ,Electronic Fund Transfer Act, for consumer transactions. Provider's responsibility and consumer's liability are regulated under Regulation E.,[32],[33],

,
Virtual currencies pose challenges for central banks, financial regulators, departments or ministries of finance, as well as fiscal authorities and statistical authorities.
,
,U.S. Treasury guidance,
,On March 20, 2013, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued a guidance to clarify how the U.S. ,Bank Secrecy Act, applied to persons creating, exchanging, and transmitting virtual currencies.,[34],
,
,Securities and Exchange Commission guidance,
,In May 2014 the U.S. ,Securities and Exchange Commission, (SEC) ""warned about the hazards of bitcoin and other virtual currencies"".,[35],
,
,New York state regulation,
,In July 2014, the ,New York State Department of Financial Services, proposed the most comprehensive regulation of virtual currencies to date, commonly called ,BitLicense,.,[36], Unlike the US federal regulators it has gathered input from bitcoin supporters and the financial industry through public hearings and a comment period until 21 October 2014 to customize the rules. The proposal per NY DFS press release “sought to strike an appropriate balance that helps protect consumers and root out illegal activity"".,[,citation needed,], It has been criticized by smaller companies to favor established institutions, and Chinese bitcoin exchanges have complained that the rules are ""overly broad in its application outside the United States"".,[37],
,
,Adoption by governments,
,As of 2016, over 24 countries are investing in distributed ledger technologies (DLT) with $1.4bn in investments. In addition, over 90 ,central banks, are engaged in DLT discussions, including implications of a ,central bank issued digital currency,.,[38],
,
,Hong Kong,’s ,Octopus card, system: Launched in 1997 as an electronic purse for public transportation, is the most successful and mature implementation of contactless smart cards used for mass transit payments. After only 5 years, 25 percent of Octopus card transactions are unrelated to transit, and accepted by more than 160 merchants.,[39],
,London, Transport’s ,Oyster card, system: Oyster is a plastic smartcard which can hold pay as you go credit, Travelcards and Bus & Tram season tickets. You can use an Oyster card to travel on bus, Tube, tram, DLR, London Overground and most National Rail services in London.,[40],
,Japan,’s ,FeliCa,: A contactless RFID ,smart card,, used in a variety of ways such as in ticketing systems for public transportation, e-money, and residence door keys.,[41],
,The ,Netherlands,' ,Chipknip,: As an electronic cash system used in the Netherlands, all ATM cards issued by the Dutch banks had value that could be loaded via Chipknip loading stations. For people without a bank, pre-paid Chipknip cards could be purchased at various locations in the Netherlands. As of January 1, 2015, you can no longer pay with Chipknip.,[42],
,Belgium,'s ,Proton,: An ,electronic purse, application for ,debit cards, in Belgium. Introduced in February 1995, as a means to replace cash for small transactions. The system was retired in December 31, 2014.,[43],
,In March 2018, the ,Marshall Islands, became the first country to issue their own cryptocurrency and certify it as legal tender; the currency is called the ""sovereign"".,[44],
,Canada,
,The ,Bank of Canada, have explored the possibility of creating a version of its currency on the blockchain.,[45],
,The Bank of Canada teamed up with the nation’s five largest banks — and the blockchain consulting firm R3 — for what was known as Project Jasper. In a simulation run in 2016, the central bank issued CAD-Coins onto a blockchain similar ,Ethereum,.,[46], The banks used the CAD-Coins to exchange money the way they do at the end of each day to settle their master accounts.,[46],
,China,
,A deputy governor at the ,central bank of China,, Fan Yifei, wrote that ""the conditions are ripe for digital currencies, which can reduce operating costs, increase efficiency and enable a wide range of new applications"".,[46], According to Fan Yifei, the best way to take advantage of the situation is for central banks to take the lead, both in supervising private digital currencies and in developing digital legal tender of their own.,[47],
,Denmark,
,The Danish government proposed getting rid of the obligation for selected retailers to accept payment in cash, moving the country closer to a ""cashless"" economy.,[48], The Danish Chamber of Commerce is backing the move.,[49], Nearly a third of the Danish population uses ,MobilePay,, a smartphone application for transferring money.,[48],
,Ecuador,
,A law passed by the ,National Assembly of Ecuador, gives the government permission to make payments in electronic currency and proposes the creation of a national digital currency. ""Electronic money will stimulate the economy; it will be possible to attract more Ecuadorian citizens, especially those who do not have checking or savings accounts and credit cards alone. The electronic currency will be backed by the assets of the Central Bank of Ecuador"", the National Assembly said in a statement.,[50], In December 2015, Sistema de Dinero Electrónico (""electronic money system"") was launched, making Ecuador the first country with a state-run electronic payment system.,[51],
,Germany,
,The ,German central bank, is testing a functional prototype for the blockchain technology-based settlement of securities and transfer of centrally-issued digital coins.,[52],[53],
,Netherlands,
,The ,Dutch central bank, is experimenting with a bitcoin-based virtual currency called “DNBCoin”.,[46],[54],
,India,
,Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is an instant real-time payment system developed by National Payments Corporation of India facilitating inter-bank transactions. The interface is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India and works by instantly transferring funds between two bank accounts on a mobile platform.
UPI is built over Immediate Payment Service(IMPS) for transferring funds. Being a digital payment system it is available 24*7 and across public holidays. Unlike traditional mobile wallets, which takes a specified amount of money from user and stores it in its own accounts, UPI withdraws and deposits funds directly from the bank account whenever a transaction is requested. It uses Virtual Payment Address (a unique ID provided by the bank), Account Number with IFS Code, Mobile Number with MMID (Mobile Money Identifier), Aadhaar Number, or a one-time use Virtual ID. An UPI-PIN (UPI Personal Identification number that one creates on the UPI app of the bank) is required to confirm each payment.
,Russia,
,Government-controlled ,Sberbank of Russia, owns ,Yandex.Money, – electronic payment service and digital currency of the same name.,[55],
Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has signed off on regulation of ICOs and cryptocurrency mining by July 2018.,[56],
,South Korea,
,South Korea, plans national digital currency using a Blockchain.,[57], The chairman of South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC), Yim Jong-yong, announced that his department will ""Lay the systemic groundwork for the spread of digital currency."",[57], South Korea has already announced plans to discontinue coins by the year 2020.,[58],
,Sweden,
,Sweden, is in the process of replacing all of its physical banknotes, and most of its coins by mid-2017. However, the new banknotes and coins of the ,Swedish krona, will probably be circulating at about half the 2007 peak of 12,494 kronor per capita. The ,Riksbank, is planning to begin discussions of an electronic currency issued by the central bank to which ""is not to replace cash, but to act as complement to it"".,[59], Deputy Governor ,Cecilia Skingsley, states that cash will continue to spiral out of use in Sweden, and while it is currently fairly easy to get cash in Sweden, it is often very difficult to deposit it into bank accounts, especially in rural areas. No decision has been currently made about the decision to create ""e-krona"".  In her speech, Skingsley states: ""The first question is whether e-krona should be booked in accounts or whether the ekrona should be some form of a digitally transferable unit that does not need an underlying account structure, roughly like cash."" Skingsley also states: ""Another important question is whether the Riksbank should issue e-krona directly to the general public or go via the banks, as we do now with banknotes and coins."" Other questions will be addressed like interest rates, should they be positive, negative, or zero?
,Switzerland,
,In 2016, a ,city government, first accepted digital currency in payment of city fees.  ,Zug, Switzerland,, added bitcoin as a means of paying small amounts, up to 200 SFr., in a test and an attempt to advance Zug as a region that is advancing future technologies.  In order to reduce risk, Zug immediately converts any bitcoin received into the Swiss currency.,[60],Swiss Federal Railways,, government-owned railway company of Switzerland, sells bitcoins at its ticket machines.,[61],[61],
,UK,
,The Chief Scientific Adviser to the UK government advised his Prime Minister and Parliament to consider using a blockchain-based digital currency.,[62],
,The chief economist of ,Bank of England,, the central bank of the United Kingdom, proposed abolition of paper currency. The Bank has also taken an interest in bitcoin.,[46],[63], In 2016 it has embarked on a multi-year research programme to explore the implications of a central bank issued digital currency.,[38], The Bank of England has produced several research papers on the topic. One suggests that the economic benefits of issuing a digital currency on a distributed ledger could add as much as 3 percent to a country's economic output.,[46], The Bank said that it wanted the next version of the bank’s basic software infrastructure to be compatible with distributed ledgers.,[46],
,Ukraine,
,The ,National Bank of Ukraine, is considering a creation of its own issuance/turnover/servicing system for a blockchain-based national cryptocurrency.,[64], The regulator also announced that blockchain could be a part of a national project called ""Cashless Economy"".,[64],
,
,Adoption by financial actors,
,Government attitude dictates the tendency among established heavy financial actors that both are risk-averse and conservative. None of these offered services around cryptocurrencies and much of the criticism came from them.
,The first mover among these has been ,Fidelity Investments,, ,Boston, based ,Fidelity Digital Assets, LLC will provide enterprise-grade custody solutions, a cryptocurrency trading execution platform and institutional advising services 24 hours a day, seven days a week designed to align with blockchain's always-on trading cycle"".,[65], It will work with ,Bitcoin, and ,Ethereum, with general availability scheduled for 2019.
,
,Hard vs. soft digital currencies,
,Hard electronic currency does not have the ability to be disputed or reversed when used. It is nearly impossible to reverse a transaction, justified or not. It is very similar to cash. Advantages of this system include it being cheaper to operate, and transactions are instantaneous. Western Union, ,KlickEx, and ,Bitcoin, are examples of this type of currency.,[66],
,Soft electronic currencies are the opposite of hard electronic currencies. Payments can be reversed. Usually, when a payment is reversed there is a ""clearing time."" This can take 72 hours or more. Examples of soft currencies are ,PayPal, and any type of ,credit card,. A hard currency can be ""softened"" with a third party service.,[66],
,
,Criticism,
,Many existing digital currencies have not yet seen widespread usage, and may not be easily used or exchanged. Banks generally do not accept or offer services for them.,[67], There are concerns that cryptocurrencies are extremely risky due to their very high ,volatility,[68], and potential for ,pump and dump, schemes.,[69],  Regulators in several countries have warned against their use and some have taken concrete regulatory measures to dissuade users.,[70], The non-cryptocurrencies are all ,centralized,. As such, they may be shut down or seized by a government at any time.,[71],  The more anonymous a currency is, the more attractive it is to criminals, regardless of the intentions of its creators.,[71], ,Forbes, writer ,Tim Worstall, has written that the value of bitcoin is largely derived from speculative trading.,[72],  Bitcoin has also been criticised for its energy inefficient SHA-256-based ,proof of work,.,[73],

,History,[,edit,],
,Peter Thiel announced the fellowship at TechCrunch Disrupt in September 2010.,[1], The first round of fellows, based on applications made at the end of 2010, was announced in May 2011.,[2],[3], The second round of fellows, based on applications made at the end of 2011, was announced in June 2012.,[4],[5], The third class (announced in May 2013) includes 22 fellows working on projects from garment manufacturing and B2B web products to ARM powered servers and biomedicine. The class includes 7 fellows from outside of the US.,[6], In December 2013, ,Lora Kolodny, wrote an article for the ,Wall Street Journal, reviewing the Thiel Fellowship, where she wrote: ""64 Thiel Fellows have started 67 for-profit ventures, raised $55.4 million in angel and venture funding, published two books, created 30 apps and 135 full-time jobs, and brought clean water and solar power to 6,000 Kenyans who needed it."",[7], The 2014 Thiel Fellows were announced in June 2014.,[8],

,
,Reception,[,edit,],
,Initial reception,[,edit,],
,Thiel's announcement of the Thiel Fellowship met with a diverse array of responses. Some, such as ,Jacob Weisberg,, criticized Thiel's proposal for its utopianism and attack on the importance of education.,[24], Others, such as ,Vivek Wadhwa,, expressed skepticism about whether the success or failure of the Thiel Fellowship would carry any broader lessons regarding the value of higher education or the wisdom of dropping out.,[25],
,In May 2011, shortly after the announcement of the first batch of Thiel Fellows, the admissions office at the ,Massachusetts Institute of Technology, congratulated two MIT students for receiving the Thiel Fellowship. Both students would need to drop out of MIT to receive the fellowship, but would be able to return to MIT to resume their studies after completing the two-year term of the fellowship if they so desired.,[26],
,
,Later reception,[,edit,],
,A year after the announcement of the first batch of Thiel Fellows, opinions on the program ranged from the skeptical and critical to the laudatory and optimistic, as seen in the answers to a ,Quora, question about the achievements of the first batch of Thiel Fellows.,[27],
,Eric Markowitz offered a mixed review of the Thiel Fellowship in ,Inc., magazine.,[28],
,In April 2013, an article by Richard Nieva for ,PandoDaily, took a close look at how the first batch of Thiel Fellows had fared.,[29],
,The Thiel Fellowship aimed to remove the gender diversity gap.,[30],
,A Quora question asked in 2013 about the final results for the Thiel fellows had received one response as of September 2013, attempting to trace each of the Thiel Fellows.,[31],
,In September 2013, ,Vivek Wadhwa, wrote that the Thiel Fellowship had failed to produce any notable successes to date, and even its limited successes were instances where the Thiel Fellows were working in collaboration with more experienced individuals.,[16],
,On October 10, 2013, former ,Harvard University, President ,Larry Summers, was reported as having said at the ,Nantucket Project, conference: ""I think the single most misdirected bit of philanthropy in this decade is Peter Thiel's special program to bribe people to drop out of college."" His remarks were reported on by many media outlets, ranging from ,TechCrunch, to ,Valleywag,.,[32],[33],[34], On October 13, ,TechCrunch, published a response to Summers co-written by a Thiel Fellow and a mentor for the Thiel Fellowship program.,[35],
,In late December 2013, Thiel Fellow Delian Asparouhov published a lengthy article giving advice on how to select a project and present it to maximize one's chances with the Thiel Fellowship application.,[36],

,Overview,[,edit,],
,Ledger, is an ,open access, journal published by the ,University Library System, (ULS) of the ,University of Pittsburgh, and is cosponsored by the ,University of Pittsburgh Press,.,[4], The journal expects to release full-publications twice a year and additional articles throughout.,[5], Individuals such as ,Michael Kumhof,, Senior Research Advisor at the ,Bank of England,,,[6], and ,Vitalik Buterin,, co-founder of ,Ethereum,, as well as academics from a variety of institutions including ,Oxford,, ,Stanford, and ,MIT, currently make up the editorial team.,[7], ,Ledger, has received partial funding from ,Bitcoin Unlimited,.,[8],
,The idea for ,Ledger, was born out of a discussion between managing editors Peter R. Rizun and Christopher E. Wilmer on the bitcoin forum bitcointalk.org. A call for papers was issued on 15 September 2015 with the deadline set at 31 December 2015 but following delays in formalising the review process the inaugural issue was not published until December 2016.,[9],[3],[5],[10],[11],
,The journal encourages authors to ,digitally sign, a ,file hash, of submitted papers, which will then be ,timestamped, into the bitcoin ,blockchain,. Authors are also asked to include a personal bitcoin address in the first page of their papers.,[12],[13],

,Russian, (,русский язык, ,tr., rússkiy yazýk,) is an ,East Slavic language,, which is ,official, in ,Russia,, ,Belarus,, ,Kazakhstan, and ,Kyrgyzstan,, as well as being widely spoken throughout ,Eastern Europe,, the ,Baltic states,, the ,Caucasus, and ,Central Asia,.,[31],[32], It was the ,de facto, language of the ,Soviet Union, until its ,dissolution, on 25 December 1991.,[33],
,Russian belongs to the family of ,Indo-European languages,, one of the four living members of the East Slavic languages, and part of the larger ,Balto-Slavic, branch. Written examples of ,Old East Slavonic, are attested from the 10th century onward.
,It is the most widely spoken of the Slavic languages and the largest ,native language, in Europe, with 144 million speakers in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Russian is the eighth most spoken language in the world ,by number of native speakers, and the seventh ,by total number of speakers,.,[34], The language is one of the ,six official languages, of the ,United Nations,. Russian is also the third most widespread language on the ,Internet, after ,English, and ,German,, respectively.,[35],
,Russian distinguishes between ,consonant, ,phonemes, with ,palatal, ,secondary articulation, and those without, the so-called ,soft, and ,hard, sounds. Almost every consonant has a hard or a soft counterpart, and the distinction is a prominent feature of the language. Another important aspect is the ,reduction, of ,unstressed, ,vowels,. Stress, which is unpredictable, is not normally indicated ,orthographically,[36], though an optional ,acute accent, may be used to mark ,stress,, such as to distinguish between ,homographic, words, for example ,замо́к, (zamók, meaning ,a lock,) and ,за́мок, (zámok, meaning ,a castle,), or to indicate the proper pronunciation of uncommon words or names.

,Classification,[,edit,],
,Russian is an ,East Slavic language, of the wider ,Indo-European family,. It is a lineal,[,citation needed,], descendant of the language used in ,Kievan Rus',, a loose conglomerate of ,East Slavic, tribes from the late 9th to the mid 13th centuries. From the point of view of ,spoken language,, its closest relatives are ,Ukrainian,, ,Belarusian,, and ,Rusyn,,,[37], the other three languages in the East Slavic languages. In many places in eastern and southern ,Ukraine, and throughout ,Belarus,, these languages are spoken interchangeably, and in certain areas traditional bilingualism resulted in language mixtures such as ,Surzhyk, in eastern Ukraine and ,Trasianka, in ,Belarus,. An East Slavic ,Old Novgorod dialect,, although vanished during the 15th or 16th century, is sometimes considered to have played a significant role in the formation of modern Russian. Also Russian has notable lexical similarities with Bulgarian due to a common ,Church Slavonic, influence on both languages, as well as because of later interaction in the 19th and 20th centuries, although Bulgarian grammar differs markedly from Russian.,[38], In the 19th century (in Russia until 1917), the language was often called "",Great Russian,"" to distinguish it from Belarusian, then called ""White Russian"" and Ukrainian, then called ""Little Russian"".
,The ,vocabulary, (mainly abstract and literary words), principles of word formations, and, to some extent, inflections and literary style of Russian have been also influenced by ,Church Slavonic,, a developed and partly russified form of the ,South Slavic, ,Old Church Slavonic, language used by the ,Russian Orthodox Church,. However, the East Slavic forms have tended to be used exclusively in the various dialects that are experiencing a rapid decline. In some cases, both the East Slavic and the ,Church Slavonic, forms are in use, with many different meanings. ,For details, see ,Russian phonology, and ,History of the Russian language,.,
,Over the course of centuries, the vocabulary and literary style of Russian have also been influenced by Western and Central European languages such as ,Greek,, ,Latin,, ,Polish,, ,Dutch,, ,German,, ,French,, ,Italian, and ,English,,,[39], and to a lesser extent the languages to the south and the east: ,Uralic,, ,Turkic,,,[40],[41], ,Persian,,,[42],[43], and ,Arabic,, as well as ,Hebrew,.,[44],
,According to the ,Defense Language Institute, in ,Monterey, California,, Russian is classified as a level III language in terms of learning difficulty for native ,English, speakers, requiring approximately 1,100 hours of immersion instruction to achieve intermediate fluency.,[45], It is also regarded by the ,United States Intelligence Community, as a ""hard target"" language, due to both its difficulty to master for English speakers and its critical role in ,U.S. world policy,.
,
,Standard Russian,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Moscovian dialect,
,The standard form of Russian is generally regarded as the ,modern Russian literary language, (,современный русский литературный язык,). It arose in the beginning of the 18th century with the modernization reforms of the Russian state under the rule of ,Peter the Great,, and developed from the Moscow (,Middle or Central Russian,) dialect substratum under the influence of some of the previous century's Russian chancellery language.
,Mikhail Lomonosov, first compiled a normalizing grammar book in 1755; in 1783 the ,Russian Academy,'s first explanatory Russian dictionary appeared. During the end of the 18th and 19th centuries, a period known as the ""Golden Age"", the grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation of the Russian language was stabilized and standardized, and it became the nationwide literary language; meanwhile, Russia's world-famous literature flourished.
,Until the 20th century, the language's spoken form was the language of only the upper noble classes and urban population, as Russian peasants from the countryside continued to speak in their own dialects. By the mid-20th century, such dialects were forced out with the introduction of the compulsory education system that was established by the ,Soviet government,. Despite the formalization of Standard Russian, some nonstandard dialectal features (such as fricative ,[ɣ], in ,Southern Russian dialects,) are still observed in colloquial speech.
,
,Geographic distribution,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Geographical distribution of Russian speakers,
,  ,Competence of Russian in countries of the former Soviet Union (except Russia), 2004,
,In 2010, there were 259.8 million speakers of Russian in the world: in Russia – 137.5 million, in the ,CIS, and Baltic countries – 93.7 million, in Eastern Europe – 12.9 million, Western Europe – 7.3 million, Asia – 2.7 million, Middle East and North Africa – 1.3 million, Sub-Saharan Africa – 0.1 million, Latin America – 0.2 million, U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand – 4.1 million speakers. Therefore, the Russian language is the ,7th largest in the world by number of speakers,, after English, Mandarin, Hindi-Urdu, Spanish, and Arabic.,[46],
,Russian is one of the ,six official languages, of the ,United Nations,. Education in Russian is still a popular choice for both Russian as a second language (RSL) and native speakers in ,Russia, as well as many of the former Soviet republics. Russian is still seen as an important language for children to learn in most of the former Soviet republics.,[47], ,Samuel P. Huntington, wrote in the ,Clash of Civilizations,, ""During the heyday of the Soviet Union, Russian was the ,lingua franca, from Prague to Hanoi."",[48],
,
,Europe,[,edit,],
,In ,Belarus,, Russian is co-official alongside Belarusian per the ,Constitution of Belarus,.,[49], 77% of the population was fluent in Russian in 2006, and 67% used it as the main language with family, friends, or at work.,[50],
,In ,Estonia,, Russian is spoken by 29.6% of the population according to a 2011 estimate from the World Factbook.,[51], and is officially considered a foreign language.,[49],
,In ,Latvia,, Russian is officially considered a foreign language.,[49], 55% of the population was fluent in Russian in 2006, and 26% used it as the main language with family, friends, or at work.,[50], On 18 February 2012, Latvia held a ,constitutional referendum, on whether to adopt Russian as a second official language.,[52], According to the Central Election Commission, 74.8% voted against, 24.9% voted for and the voter turnout was 71.1%.,[53],
,In ,Lithuania,, Russian is not official, but it still retains the function of a ,lingua franca,.,[49], In contrast to the other two Baltic states, Lithuania has a relatively small Russian-speaking minority (5.0% as of 2008).,[54],
,In ,Moldova,, Russian is considered to be the language of inter-ethnic communication under a Soviet-era law.,[49], 50% of the population was fluent in Russian in 2006, and 19% used it as the main language with family, friends, or at work.,[50],
,According to the ,2010 census in Russia,, Russian language skills were indicated by 138 million people (99.4% of the population), while according to the ,2002 census, – 142.6 million people (99.2% of the population).,[55],
,In ,Ukraine,, Russian is seen as a language of inter-ethnic communication, and a minority language, under the 1996 ,Constitution of Ukraine,.,[49], According to estimates from Demoskop Weekly, in 2004 there were 14,400,000 native speakers of Russian in the country, and 29 million active speakers.,[56], 65% of the population was fluent in Russian in 2006, and 38% used it as the main language with family, friends, or at work.,[50],
,In the 20th century, Russian was a mandatory language taught in the schools of the members of the old ,Warsaw Pact, and in other ,countries, that used to be satellites of the USSR. According to the Eurobarometer 2005 survey,,[57], fluency in Russian remains fairly high (20–40%) in some countries, in particular those where the people speak a ,Slavic language, and thereby have an edge in learning Russian (namely, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Bulgaria).
,Significant Russian-speaking groups also exist in ,Western Europe,. These have been fed by several waves of immigrants since the beginning of the 20th century, each with its own flavor of language. The ,United Kingdom,, ,Germany,, ,Finland,, ,Spain,, ,Portugal,, ,France,, ,Italy,, ,Belgium,, ,Greece,, ,Norway,, and ,Austria, have significant Russian-speaking communities.
,
,Asia,[,edit,],
,In ,Armenia,, Russian has no official status, but it is recognized as a minority language under the ,Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities,.,[49], 30% of the population was fluent in Russian in 2006, and 2% used it as the main language with family, friends, or at work.,[50],
,In ,Azerbaijan,, Russian has no official status, but is a ,lingua franca, of the country.,[49], 26% of the population was fluent in Russian in 2006, and 5% used it as the main language with family, friends, or at work.,[50],
,In ,China,, Russian has no official status, but it is spoken by the small Russian communities in the Northeastern ,Heilongjiang, province.
,In ,Georgia,, Russian has no official status, but it is recognized as a minority language under the ,Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities,.,[49], Russian is the language of 9% of the population according to the World Factbook.,[58], Ethnologue cites Russian as the country's de facto working language.,[59],
,In ,Kazakhstan,, Russian is not a state language, but according to article 7 of the ,Constitution of Kazakhstan, its usage enjoys equal status to that of the ,Kazakh language, in state and local administration.,[49], The 2009 census reported that 10,309,500 people, or 84.8% of the population aged 15 and above, could read and write well in Russian, as well as understand the spoken language.,[60],
,In ,Kyrgyzstan,, Russian is an official language per article 5 of the ,Constitution of Kyrgyzstan,.,[49], The 2009 census states that 482,200 people speak Russian as a native language, or 8.99% of the population.,[61], Additionally, 1,854,700 residents of Kyrgyzstan aged 15 and above fluently speak Russian as a second language, or 49.6% of the population in the age group.,[61],
,In ,Tajikistan,, Russian is the language of inter-ethnic communication under the ,Constitution of Tajikistan, and is permitted in official documentation.,[49], 28% of the population was fluent in Russian in 2006, and 7% used it as the main language with family, friends or at work.,[50], The World Factbook notes that Russian is widely used in government and business.,[51],
,In ,Turkmenistan,, Russian lost its status as the official ,lingua franca, in 1996.,[49], Russian is spoken by 12% of the population according to an undated estimate from the World Factbook.,[51],
,In ,Uzbekistan,, Russian is de facto the second official language,[8],[9],[10],. Has some official roles, being permitted in official documentation and is the ,lingua franca, of the country and the language of the élite.,[49],[62], Russian is spoken by 14.2% of the population according to an undated estimate from the World Factbook.,[51], 
,In 2005, Russian was the most widely taught foreign language in ,Mongolia,,,[63], and was compulsory in Year 7 onward as a second foreign language in 2006.,[64],
,Russian is also spoken in ,Israel,. The number of native Russian-speaking Israelis numbers around 1.5 million Israelis.,[65], The Israeli ,press, and ,websites, regularly publish material in Russian.,[,citation needed,],. With ,Israel Plus,, there is an Israeli TV channel mainly broadcasting in Russian. See also ,Russian language in Israel,.
,Russian is also spoken as a second language by a small number of people in Afghanistan.,[66],
,
,North America,[,edit,],
,See also: ,Russian language in the United States,
,The language was first introduced in ,North America, when ,Russian explorers, voyaged into ,Alaska, and claimed it for Russia during the 18th century. Although most Russian colonists left after the United States bought the land in 1867, a handful stayed and preserved the Russian language in this region to this day, although only a few elderly speakers of this unique dialect are left.,[67], Sizable Russian-speaking communities also exist in ,North America,, especially in large urban centers of the ,U.S., and ,Canada,, such as ,New York City,, ,Philadelphia,, ,Boston,, ,Los Angeles,, ,Nashville,, ,San Francisco,, ,Seattle,, ,Spokane,, ,Toronto,, ,Baltimore,, ,Miami,, ,Chicago,, ,Denver,, and ,Cleveland,. In a number of locations they issue their own newspapers, and live in ,ethnic enclaves, (especially the generation of immigrants who started arriving in the early 1960s). Only about 25% of them are ethnic Russians, however. Before the ,dissolution of the Soviet Union,, the overwhelming majority of ,Russophones, in ,Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, in New York City were Russian-speaking ,Jews,. Afterward, the influx from the countries of the former ,Soviet Union, changed the statistics somewhat, with ethnic Russians and Ukrainians immigrating along with some more Russian Jews and Central Asians. According to the ,United States Census,, in 2007 Russian was the primary language spoken in the homes of over 850,000 individuals living in the United States.,[68],

,In March 2013 it was announced that Russian is now the second-most used language on the Internet after English. People use the Russian language on 5.9% of all websites, slightly ahead of German and far behind English (54.7%). Russian is used not only on 89.8% of ,.ru, sites, but also on 88.7% of sites with the former Soviet Union domain ,.su,.

,Russian is a rather homogeneous language, in terms of dialectal variation, due to the early political centralization under Moscow's rule, compulsory education, mass migration from rural to urban areas in the 20th century, as well as other factors. The standard language is used in written and spoken form almost everywhere in the country, from Kaliningrad and Saint Petersburg in the West to Vladivostok and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the East, notwithstanding the enormous distance in between.
,Despite leveling after 1900, especially in matters of vocabulary and phonetics, a number of dialects still exist in Russia. Some linguists divide the dialects of Russian into two primary regional groupings, ""Northern"" and ""Southern"", with ,Moscow, lying on the zone of transition between the two. Others divide the language into three groupings, ,Northern,, ,Central, (or Middle) and ,Southern,, with Moscow lying in the Central region.,[70],[71], All dialects also divided in two main chronological categories: the dialects of ,primary formation, (the territory of ,Muscovy,, roughly consists of the modern ,Central, and ,Northwestern, Federal districts); and ,secondary formation, (other territory). ,Dialectology, within Russia recognizes dozens of smaller-scale variants. The dialects often show distinct and non-standard features of pronunciation and intonation, vocabulary and grammar. Some of these are relics of ancient usage now completely discarded by the standard language.
,The ,Northern Russian dialects, and those spoken along the ,Volga River, typically pronounce unstressed ,/o/, clearly, a phenomenon called ,okanye, (,оканье,).,[71], Besides the absence of vowel reduction, some dialects have ,high, or ,diphthongal, ,/e⁓i̯ɛ/, in the place of ,Proto-Slavic, *,ě, and ,/o⁓u̯ɔ/, in stressed closed syllables (as in Ukrainian) instead of Standard Russian ,/e/, and ,/o/,.,[71], An interesting morphological feature is a post-posed definite article ,-to,, ,-ta,, ,-te, similarly to that existing in Bulgarian and Macedonian.,[71],
,In the ,Southern Russian dialects,, instances of unstressed ,/e/, and ,/a/, following ,palatalized, consonants and preceding a stressed syllable are not reduced to ,[ɪ], (as occurs in the Moscow dialect), being instead pronounced ,[a], in such positions (e.g. ,несл,и, is pronounced ,[nʲaˈslʲi],, not ,[nʲɪsˈlʲi],) – this is called ,yakanye, (,яканье,).,[71],[72],
Consonants include a ,fricative ,/ɣ/,, a ,semivowel ,/w⁓u̯/, and ,/x⁓xv⁓xw/,, whereas the Standard and Northern dialects have the consonants ,/ɡ/,, ,/v/,, and final ,/l/, and ,/f/,, respectively.,[71],
The morphology features a palatalized final ,/tʲ/, in 3rd person forms of verbs (this is unpalatalized in the Standard and Northern dialects).,[71],[73], Some of these features such as akanye and yakanye, a ,debuccalized, or ,lenited, ,/ɡ/,, a ,semivowel ,/w⁓u̯/, and palatalized final ,/tʲ/, in 3rd person forms of verbs are also present in modern ,Belarusian, and some dialects of ,Ukrainian, (Eastern ,Polesian,), indicating a linguistic continuum.
,The city of ,Veliky Novgorod, has historically displayed a feature called ,chokanye, or ,tsokanye, (,чоканье, or ,цоканье,), in which ,/tɕ/, and ,/ts/, were switched or merged. So, ,ц,апля, ('heron') has been recorded as ,чапля,. Also, the ,second palatalization, of ,velars, did not occur there, so the so-called ,ě², (from the ,Proto-Slavic, diphthong *ai) did not cause ,/k, ɡ, x/, to shift to ,/ts, dz, s/,; therefore, where Standard Russian has ,ц,епь, ('chain'), the form ,к,епь, ,[kʲepʲ], is attested in earlier texts.
,Among the first to study Russian dialects was ,Lomonosov, in the 18th century. In the 19th, ,Vladimir Dal, compiled the first dictionary that included dialectal vocabulary. Detailed mapping of Russian dialects began at the turn of the 20th century. In modern times, the monumental ,Dialectological Atlas of the Russian Language, (,Диалектологический атлас русского языка, ,[dʲɪɐˌlʲɛktəɫɐˈɡʲitɕɪskʲɪj ˈatɫəs ˈruskəvə jɪzɨˈka],), was published in three folio volumes 1986–1989, after four decades of preparatory work.

,Older letters of the Russian alphabet include ⟨,ѣ,⟩, which merged to ⟨,е,⟩ (,/je/, or ,/ʲe/,); ⟨,і,⟩ and ⟨,ѵ,⟩, which both merged to ⟨,и,⟩ (,/i/,); ⟨,ѳ,⟩, which merged to ⟨,ф,⟩ (,/f/,); ⟨,ѫ,⟩, which merged to ⟨,у,⟩ (,/u/,); ⟨,ѭ,⟩, which merged to ⟨,ю,⟩ (,/ju/, or ,/ʲu/,); and ⟨,ѧ,⟩ and ⟨,ѩ,⟩, which later were graphically reshaped into ⟨,я,⟩ and merged phonetically to ,/ja/, or ,/ʲa/,. While these older letters have been abandoned at one time or another, they may be used in this and related articles. The ,yers, ⟨,ъ,⟩ and ⟨,ь,⟩ originally indicated the pronunciation of ,ultra-short, or ,reduced, ,/ŭ/,, ,/ĭ/,.

,Because of many technical restrictions in computing and also because of the unavailability of Cyrillic keyboards abroad, Russian is often transliterated using the Latin alphabet. For example, ,мороз, ('frost') is transliterated ,moroz,, and  ,мышь, ('mouse'), ,mysh, or ,myš',. Once commonly used by the majority of those living outside Russia, transliteration is being used less frequently by Russian-speaking typists in favor of the extension of ,Unicode, ,character encoding,, which fully incorporates the Russian alphabet.  Free programs leveraging this Unicode extension are available which allow users to type Russian characters, even on Western 'QWERTY' keyboards.,[74],
,
,Computing,[,edit,],
,The Russian alphabet has many systems of ,character encoding,. ,KOI8-R, was designed by the Soviet government and was intended to serve as the standard encoding. This encoding was and still is widely used in UNIX-like operating systems. Nevertheless, the spread of ,MS-DOS, and ,OS/2, (,IBM866,), traditional Macintosh (,ISO/IEC 8859-5,) and ,Microsoft Windows, (CP1251) created chaos and ended by establishing different encodings as de facto standards, with Windows-1251 becoming a ,de facto standard, in Russian Internet and e-mail communication during the period of roughly 1995–2005.
,All the obsolete 8-bit encodings are rarely used in the communication protocols and text-exchange data formats, having been mostly replaced with ,UTF-8,. A number of encoding conversion applications were developed. "",iconv,"" is an example that is supported by most versions of ,Linux,, ,Macintosh, and some other ,operating systems,; but converters are rarely needed unless accessing texts created more than a few years ago.
,In addition to the modern Russian alphabet, Unicode (and thus UTF-8) encodes the ,Early Cyrillic alphabet, (which is very similar to the ,Greek alphabet,), as well as all other Slavic and non-Slavic but Cyrillic-based alphabets.
,
,Orthography,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Russian orthography,
,Russian spelling is reasonably phonemic in practice. It is in fact a balance among phonemics, morphology, etymology, and grammar; and, like that of most living languages, has its share of inconsistencies and controversial points. A number of rigid ,spelling rules, introduced between the 1880s and 1910s have been responsible for the former whilst trying to eliminate the latter.
,The current spelling follows the major reform of 1918, and the final codification of 1956. An update proposed in the late 1990s has met a hostile reception, and has not been formally adopted. The punctuation, originally based on ,Byzantine Greek,, was in the 17th and 18th centuries reformulated on the French and German models.
,According to the Institute of Russian Language of the Russian Academy of Sciences, an optional ,acute accent, (,знак ударения,) may, and sometimes should, be used to mark ,stress,. For example, it is used to distinguish between otherwise identical words, especially when context does not make it obvious: ,замо́к, – ,за́мок, (""lock"" – ""castle""), ,сто́ящий, – ,стоя́щий, (""worthwhile"" – ""standing""), ,чудно́, – ,чу́дно, (""this is odd"" – ""this is marvelous""), ,молоде́ц, – ,мо́лодец, (""attaboy"" – ""fine young man""), ,узна́ю, – ,узнаю́, (""I shall learn it"" – ""I recognize it""), ,отреза́ть, – ,отре́зать, (""to be cutting"" – ""to have cut""); to indicate the proper pronunciation of uncommon words, especially personal and family names (,афе́ра,, ,гу́ру,, ,Гарси́я,, ,Оле́ша,, ,Фе́рми,), and to show which is the stressed word in a sentence (,Ты́ съел печенье? – Ты съе́л печенье? – Ты съел пече́нье?, ""Was it ,you, who ate the cookie? – Did you ,eat, the cookie? – Was it the ,cookie, that you ate?""). Stress marks are mandatory in lexical dictionaries and books for children or Russian learners.
,
,Phonology,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Russian phonology,
,The phonological system of Russian is inherited from ,Common Slavonic,; it underwent considerable modification in the early historical period before being largely settled around the year 1400.
,The language possesses five vowels (or six, under the St., ,Petersburg Phonological School), which are written with different letters depending on whether the preceding consonant is ,palatalized,. The consonants typically come in plain vs. palatalized pairs, which are traditionally called ,hard, and ,soft., (The ,hard, consonants are often ,velarized,, especially before front vowels, as in ,Irish,). The standard language, based on the Moscow dialect, possesses heavy stress and moderate variation in pitch. Stressed vowels are somewhat lengthened, while unstressed vowels tend to be reduced to near-close vowels or an unclear ,schwa,. (See also: ,vowel reduction in Russian,.)
,The Russian ,syllable, structure can be quite complex, with both initial and final consonant clusters of up to four consecutive sounds. Using a formula with V standing for the nucleus (vowel) and C for each consonant, the structure can be described as follows:
,(C)(C)(C)(C)V(C)(C)(C)(C)
,Clusters of four consonants are not very common, however, especially within a morpheme. Some examples are: ,взгляд, (,[vzglʲat],, 'glance'), ,государств, (,[gəsʊˈdarstf],, 'of the states'), ,строительств, (,[strɐˈitʲɪlʲstf],, 'of the constructions').

,Russian is notable for its distinction based on ,palatalization, of most of the consonants. While ,/k, ɡ, x/, do have palatalized ,allophones, ,[kʲ, ɡʲ, xʲ],, only ,/kʲ/, might be considered a phoneme, though it is marginal and generally not considered distinctive. The only native ,minimal pair, that argues for ,/kʲ/, being a separate phoneme is ,это ,ткёт, (,[ˈɛtə tkʲɵt],, 'it weaves') – ,этот ,кот, (,[ˈɛtət kot],, 'this cat'). Palatalization means that the center of the tongue is raised during and after the articulation of the consonant. In the case of ,/tʲ/, and ,/dʲ/,, the tongue is raised enough to produce slight frication (affricate sounds; cf. Belarusian ць, дзь, or Polish ć, dź). The sounds ,/t, d, ts, s, z, n, rʲ/, are ,dental,, that is, pronounced with the tip of the tongue against the teeth rather than against the ,alveolar ridge,.

,Grammar,[,edit,],
,This section ,needs expansion,. ,You can help by ,adding to it,.,  ,(August 2014),
,Main article: ,Russian grammar,
,Russian has preserved an ,Indo-European, ,synthetic,-,inflectional, structure, although considerable levelling has taken place.
Russian grammar encompasses:
,
,a highly ,fusional, ,morphology,
,a ,syntax, that, for the literary language, is the conscious fusion of three elements:,[,citation needed,],
,a polished ,vernacular, foundation;,[,clarification needed,],
,a ,Church Slavonic, inheritance;,
,a ,Western European, style.,[,clarification needed,],
,The spoken language has been influenced by the literary one but continues to preserve characteristic forms. The dialects show various non-standard grammatical features,,[,citation needed,], some of which are archaisms or descendants of old forms since discarded by the literary language.
,The ,Church Slavonic, language was introduced to ,Moskovy, in the late 15th century and was adopted as official language for correspondence for convenience. Firstly with the newly conquered south-western regions of former Kyivan Rus and ,Grand Duchy of Lithuania,, later, when Moskovy cut its ties with the ,Golden Horde,, for communication between all newly consolidated regions of ,Moskovy,.
,In terms of actual grammar, there are three ,tenses, in Russian - past, present and future - and each verb has two ,aspects, (perfective and imperfective).  Russian nouns each have a gender - either feminine, masculine or neutral, indicated by spelling at the end of the word.  Words change depending on both their gender and function in the sentence. Russian has six ,cases,: Nominative (for the subject of the sentence), Accusative (for direct objects), Dative (for indirect objects), Genitive (to indicate possession), Instrumental (to indicate 'with' or 'by means of') and Prepositional (used after a preposition).  Verbs of motion in Russian - such as 'go', 'walk', 'run', 'swim' and 'fly' - use the imperfective or perfective form to indicate a single or return trip, and also use a multitude of ,prefixes, to add more meaning to the verb.

,History and examples,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,History of the Russian language,
,See also: ,Reforms of Russian orthography,
,The history of Russian language may be divided into the following periods,[78],:
,
,Kievan period and feudal breakup,
,The Moscow period (15th–17th centuries),
,Standard national language,
,Judging by the historical records, by approximately 1000 AD the predominant ethnic group over much of modern European ,Russia,, ,Ukraine, and ,Belarus, was the Eastern branch of the ,Slavs,, speaking a closely related group of dialects. The political unification of this region into ,Kievan Rus', in about 880, from which modern Russia, Ukraine and Belarus trace their origins, established ,Old East Slavic, as a literary and commercial language. It was soon followed by the adoption of ,Christianity, in 988 and the introduction of the South Slavic ,Old Church Slavonic, as the liturgical and official language. Borrowings and ,calques, from ,Byzantine Greek, began to enter the Old East Slavic and spoken dialects at this time, which in their turn modified the Old Church Slavonic as well.
,
,  ,The ,Ostromir Gospels, of 1056 is the second oldest ,East Slavic, book known, one of many medieval ,illuminated manuscripts, preserved in the ,Russian National Library,.,
,Dialectal differentiation accelerated after the breakup of Kievan Rus' in approximately 1100. On the territories of modern Belarus and Ukraine emerged ,Ruthenian, and in modern Russia ,medieval Russian,. They became distinct since the 13th century, i.e. following the division of that land between the ,Grand Duchy of Lithuania,, Poland and Hungary in the west and independent Novgorod and Pskov feudal republics plus numerous small duchies (which came to be vassals of the Tatars) in the east.
,The official language in Moscow and Novgorod, and later, in the growing Muscovy, was ,Church Slavonic,, which evolved from Old Church Slavonic and remained ,the literary language, for centuries, until the ,Petrine age,, when its usage became limited to biblical and liturgical texts. Russian developed under a strong influence of Church Slavonic until the close of the 17th century; afterward the influence reversed, leading to corruption of liturgical texts.
,The political reforms of ,Peter the Great, (Пётр Вели́кий, ,Pyótr Velíkiy,) were accompanied by a reform of the alphabet, and achieved their goal of secularization and Westernization. Blocks of specialized vocabulary were adopted from the languages of Western Europe. By 1800, a significant portion of the gentry spoke ,French, daily, and ,German, sometimes. Many Russian novels of the 19th century, e.g. ,Leo Tolstoy,'s (Лев Толсто́й) ,War and Peace,, contain entire paragraphs and even pages in French with no translation given, with an assumption that educated readers would not need one.
,The modern literary language is usually considered to date from the time of ,Alexander Pushkin, (,Алекса́ндр Пу́шкин,) in the first third of the 19th century. Pushkin revolutionized ,Russian literature, by rejecting archaic grammar and vocabulary (so-called ,высо́кий стиль, — ""high style"") in favor of grammar and vocabulary found in the spoken language of the time. Even modern readers of younger age may only experience slight difficulties understanding some words in Pushkin's texts, since relatively few words used by Pushkin have become archaic or changed meaning. In fact, many expressions used by Russian writers of the early 19th century, in particular Pushkin, ,Mikhail Lermontov, (,Михаи́л Ле́рмонтов,), ,Nikolai Gogol, (,Никола́й Го́голь,), ,Aleksander Griboyedov, (,Алекса́ндр Грибое́дов,), became proverbs or sayings which can be frequently found even in modern Russian colloquial speech.

,The political upheavals of the early 20th century and the wholesale changes of political ideology gave written Russian its modern appearance after the spelling reform of 1918. Political circumstances and Soviet accomplishments in military, scientific and technological matters (especially ,cosmonautics,), gave Russian a worldwide prestige, especially during the mid-20th century.
,During the ,Soviet, period, the policy toward the languages of the various other ethnic groups fluctuated in practice. Though each of the constituent republics had its own official language, the unifying role and superior status was reserved for Russian, although it was declared the ,official language, only in 1990.,[79], Following the ,break-up of the USSR, in 1991, several of the newly independent states have encouraged their native languages, which has partly reversed the privileged status of Russian, though its role as the language of post-Soviet national discourse throughout the region has continued.
,The Russian language in the world declined after 1991 due to the collapse of the Soviet Union and decrease in the number of ,Russians, in the world and diminution of the total population in ,Russia, (where Russian is an official language), however this has since been reversed.,[46],[80],[81],

,According to figures published in 2006 in the journal "",Demoskop Weekly,"" research deputy director of Research Center for Sociological Research of the ,Ministry of Education and Science (Russia), Arefyev A. L.,,[82], the Russian language is gradually losing its position in the world in general, and in Russia in particular.,[80],[83],[84],[85], In 2012, A. L. Arefyev published a new study ""Russian language at the turn of the 20th-21st centuries"", in which he confirmed his conclusion about the trend of weakening of the Russian language after the Soviet Union's collapse in various regions of the world (findings published in 2013 in the journal "",Demoskop Weekly,"").,[46],[86],[87],[88], In the countries of the former ,Soviet Union, the Russian language was being replaced or used in conjunction with local languages.,[46],[89], Currently the number speakers of Russian language in the world depends on the number of ,Russians, in the world and total population in ,Russia,.,[46],[80],[81],

,For the political term, see ,Benevolent dictatorship,.,
,Benevolent dictator for life, (,BDFL,) is a title given to a small number of ,open-source software development, leaders, typically project founders who retain the final say in disputes or arguments within the community. The phrase originated in 1995 with reference to ,Guido van Rossum,, creator of the ,Python programming language,,,[1],[2], while in 2018, Van Rossum stepped down as the leader in the language community after 30 years.
,Shortly after Van Rossum joined the ,Corporation for National Research Initiatives,, the term appeared in a follow-up mail by ,Ken Manheimer, to a meeting trying to create a semi-formal group that would oversee Python development and workshops; this initial use included the additional joke of naming Van Rossum the ""First Interim BDFL"".,[1], Van Rossum announced on July 12, 2018, that he would be stepping down from BDFL of Python.,[3],
,BDFL should not be confused with the more common term for open-source leaders, "",benevolent dictator,"", which was popularized by ,Eric S. Raymond,'s essay "",Homesteading the Noosphere,"" (1999).,[4], Among other topics related to ,hacker culture,, Raymond elaborates on how the nature of open source forces the ""dictatorship"" to keep itself benevolent, since a strong disagreement can lead to the ,forking, of the project under the rule of new leaders.

" 5 November 2018, at 20:21","  ,A timeline chart of how ,Linux distributions, have forked.,
,In ,software engineering,, a ,project fork, happens when developers take a copy of ,source code, from one ,software package, and start independent development on it, creating a distinct and separate piece of software. The term often implies not merely a ,development branch,, but also a split in the developer community, a form of ,schism,.,[1],
,Free and open-source software, is that which, by definition, may be forked from the original development team without prior permission, without violating ,copyright, law. However, licensed forks of proprietary software (,e.g., ,Unix,) also happen.

,Etymology,[,edit,],
,The word ""fork"" has been used to mean ""to divide in branches, go separate ways"" as early as the 14th century.,[2], In the software environment, the word evokes the ,fork, system call, which causes a running process to split itself into two (almost) identical copies that (typically) diverge to perform different tasks.,[3],
,In the context of software development, ""fork"" was used in the sense of creating a revision control "",branch,"" by ,Eric Allman, as early as 1980, in the context of ,SCCS,:,[4],
,

,
,The term was in use on ,Usenet, by 1983 for the process of creating a subgroup to move topics of discussion to.,[5],
,""Fork"" is not known to have been used in the sense of a community schism during the origins of Lucid Emacs (now ,XEmacs,) (1991) or the ,BSDs, (1993–1994); ,Russ Nelson, used the term ""shattering"" for this sort of fork in 1993, attributing it to ,John Gilmore,.,[6], However, ""fork"" was in use in the present sense by 1995 to describe the XEmacs split,,[7], and was an understood usage in the ,GNU, Project by 1996.,[8],
,
,Forking of free and open-source software,[,edit,],
,Free and open-source software may be legally forked without prior approval of those currently developing, managing, or distributing the software per both ,The Free Software Definition, and ,The Open Source Definition,:,[9],
,
,The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this, you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.,— ,The Free Software Definition,[10],
,
,3. Derived Works: The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.,— ,The Open Source Definition,[11],
,
,In free software, forks often result from a schism over different goals or personality clashes. In a fork, both parties assume nearly identical code bases, but typically only the larger group, or whoever controls the Web site, will retain the full original name and the associated user community. Thus, there is a reputation penalty associated with forking.,[9], The relationship between the different teams can be cordial or very bitter.
,Eric S. Raymond,, in his essay ,Homesteading the Noosphere,,,[12], stated that ""The most important characteristic of a fork is that it spawns competing projects that cannot later exchange code, splitting the potential developer community"". He notes in the ,Jargon File,:,[13],
,
,Forking is considered a Bad Thing—not merely because it implies a lot of wasted effort in the future, but because forks tend to be accompanied by a great deal of strife and acrimony between the successor groups over issues of legitimacy, succession, and design direction. There is serious social pressure against forking. As a result, major forks (such as the ,Gnu-Emacs,/,XEmacs, split, the fissioning of the ,386BSD, group into three daughter projects, and the short-lived GCC/EGCS split) are rare enough that they are remembered individually in hacker folklore.
,
,David A. Wheeler, notes,[9], four possible outcomes of a fork, with examples:
,
,The death of the fork. This is by far the most common case. It is easy to declare a fork, but considerable effort to continue independent development and support.,
,A re-merging of the fork (,e.g.,, ,egcs, becoming ""blessed"" as the new version of ,gcc,.),
,The death of the original (,e.g., the ,X.Org Server, succeeding and ,XFree86, dying.),
,Successful branching, typically with differentiation (,e.g.,, ,OpenBSD, and ,NetBSD,.),
,Distributed revision control, (DVCS) tools have popularised a less emotive use of the term ""fork"", blurring the distinction with ""branch"".,[14], With a DVCS such as ,Mercurial, or ,Git,, the normal way to contribute to a project, is to first create a personal branch of the repository, independent of the main repository, and later seek to have your changes integrated with it. Sites such as ,GitHub,, ,Bitbucket, and ,Launchpad, provide free DVCS hosting expressly supporting independent branches, such that the technical, social and financial barriers to forking a source code repository are massively reduced, and GitHub uses ""fork"" as its term for this method of contribution to a project.
,Forks often restart version numbering from 0.1 or 1.0 even if the original software was at version 3.0, 4.0, or 5.0. An exception is when the forked software is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the original project, ,e.g., ,MariaDB, for ,MySQL,[15], or ,LibreOffice, for ,OpenOffice.org,.
,
,Forking proprietary software,[,edit,],
,In ,proprietary software,, the copyright is usually held by the employing entity, not by the individual software developers. Proprietary code is thus more commonly forked when the owner needs to develop two or more versions, such as a ,windowed, version and a ,command line, version, or versions for differing operating systems, such as a ,word processor, for ,IBM PC, compatible machines and ,Macintosh, computers. Generally, such internal forks will concentrate on having the same look, feel, data format, and behavior between platforms so that a user familiar with one can also be productive or share documents generated on the other. This is almost always an economic decision to generate a greater ,market share, and thus pay back the associated extra development costs created by the fork.
,A notable proprietary fork not of this kind is the many varieties of proprietary ,Unix,—almost all derived from AT&T Unix under license and all called ""Unix"", but increasingly mutually incompatible.,[16], ,See, ,UNIX wars,.
,The ,BSD licenses, permit forks to become proprietary software, and some say,[,who?,], that commercial incentives thus make proprietisation almost inevitable. Examples include ,macOS, (based on the proprietary ,NeXTSTEP, and the open source ,FreeBSD,), ,Cedega, and ,CrossOver, (proprietary forks of ,Wine,, though CrossOver tracks Wine and contributes considerably), EnterpriseDB (a fork of ,PostgreSQL,, adding Oracle compatibility features,[17],), Supported PostgreSQL with their proprietary ESM storage system,,[18], and Netezza's,[19], proprietary highly scalable derivative of PostgreSQL. Some of these vendors contribute back changes to the community project, while some keep their changes as their own competitive advantages.

,Dries Buytaert, (born 19 November 1978 in ,Wilrijk,, ,Antwerp,, ,Belgium,),[1], is an ,open-source software, ,programmer, notable as founder and lead developer of the ,Drupal, content management system.,[2],[3],[4],

,
,

,Career,[,edit,],
,Buytaert defended his PhD dissertation in ,Computer Science, on 27 January 2008,[5], at ,Ghent University, in Belgium.,[6],
,From 1999-2000 he was the maintainer of the ,Linux,-,WLAN, FAQ,.,[7],
,On 1 December 2007, Dries,[8], announced, together with co-founder ,Jay Batson, the launch of a start-up called ,Acquia,.,[9], Acquia is a commercial open-source software company providing products, services, and technical support for Drupal. Acquia wants to be to Drupal what ,Red Hat, has been to ,Linux,.,[10], In 2009, Acquia helped re-launch Whitehouse.gov on Drupal.,[11],
,On 31 March 2008, Dries launched ,Mollom,, a service dedicated to stopping website spam: ""Mollom's purpose is to dramatically reduce the effort of keeping your site clean and the quality of your content high. Currently, Mollom is a spam-killing one-two punch combination of a state-of-the-art spam filter and CAPTCHA server."" Over 59,000 websites are protected by the Mollom service,,[12], including all of ,Netlog,'s messages.,[13],
,In 2008, Buytaert was elected ""Young Entrepreneurs of Tech"" by ,BusinessWeek,.,[14], He was also named to the ,MIT, ,Technology Review, ,TR35, as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.,[15],[16],
,
,Dismissal of Larry Garfield,[,edit,],
,In March of 2017, Buytaert fired veteran Drupal developer Larry Garfield and disinvited him from DrupalCon, shortly after forum posts came to light that outed Garfield as a participant in the ,Gorean subculture,. In a March 22 blog post, Garfield accused Buytaert of tolerating ,doxing, and wrote that Drupal's Community Working Group had not found any Code of Conduct violations in his history.,[17], Buytaert made a post the next day which defended the firing as necessary for fostering an inclusive community. He also wrote that his precise reasoning was confidential and that he ""did not make the decision based on the information or beliefs conveyed in Larry's blog post."",[17], Several commentators disputed this characterization citing Buytaert's criticism of Gorean gender roles in the same post and the deleted sentence ""further participation in a leadership role implies our community is complicit with and/or endorses these views, which we do not."",[18], Garfield also stated that he was ignorant of other ""things not mentioned"" that could have led to his dismissal.,[19], 85 Drupal developers posted an open letter criticizing Buytaert for his handling of the situation with ,Jon Evans, describing it as a form of ,victim blaming,.,[17],[20],

,Personal life,[,edit,],
,Buterin was born in ,Kolomna,, ,Moscow Oblast,, ,Russia,, to Dmitry Buterin, a computer scientist,,[4], and Natalia Ameline (née Chistyakova). He lived in the area until the age of six when his parents emigrated to ,Canada, in search of better employment opportunities.,[5], While in grade three of elementary school in Canada, Buterin was placed into a class for gifted children,[6], and started to understand that he was drawn to math, programming, and economics. He also had the ability to add three-digit numbers in his head at twice the speed of his peers.,[5],
,Buterin attended the ,Abelard School,, a private high school in Toronto, for four years,,[7], which he said, ""proved to be among the most interesting and productive years of my life; the closer connection between students and teachers [&] the level of depth at which the material was taught, made me want to learn, and to focus on learning as my primary goal"".,[7], Buterin has written that although he was ""never particularly inspired by the traditional education system"",,[7], when subjects were presented with ""dedication and focus on intellectual inquiry"", he said:
,
,""I noticed my attitude and my results almost immediately and drastically change. Education is ultimately much more than simply memorizing individual facts, or even learning individual concepts. [What] matters most: learning how to think, learning how to reason and learning how to learn."",[7],
,Buterin learned about Bitcoin, from his father, at age 17.,[5], In 2012, he obtained a bronze medal in the International Olympiad in Informatics.,[8], In 2013, he visited developers in other countries who shared his enthusiasm for code. He returned to Toronto later that year and published a ,white paper, proposing Ethereum.,[9], He attended the ,University of Waterloo, but dropped out in 2014, when he received the ,Thiel Fellowship, in the amount of $100,000,,[10], and went to work on Ethereum full-time.,[10],
,On June 25, 2017, Buterin was the subject of a ,death hoax, originating from ,4chan,.,[11],
,On 30 November 2018, Vitalik Buterin receives Honorary Doctorate from the Faculty of Business and Economics of the University of Basel on the occasion of the Dies Academicus. ,[12],
,
,Career,[,edit,],
,Beginnings at ,Bitcoin Magazine,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Bitcoin Magazine,
,Buterin met a person on a bitcoin chat forum trying to start a bitcoin blog. The owner offered five bitcoin (about $3.50) to anyone who would write an article for him. Buterin wrote for the site until its website shut down soon thereafter due to Bitcoin's lack of mainstream attention.,[13],
,In September 2011, another person reached out to Buterin about a new publication called ,Bitcoin Magazine,, a position which Buterin would accept as the first co-founder, and contribute as a leading writer.,[14],
,In addition Buterin wrote about bitcoin-related topics for other publications, including ,Bitcoin Weekly,.,[1],[15], ,Bitcoin Magazine, in 2012 later began publishing a print edition and has been referred to as the first serious publication dedicated to cryptocurrencies.,[16], ,Bitcoin Magazine, was then purchased by ,BTC Media,, where Buterin continued to write until mid-2014.,[,citation needed,],
,In addition, he held a position on the editorial board of ,Ledger,, a peer-reviewed scholarly journal that publishes full-length original research articles on the subjects of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.,[17],
,
,Ethereum,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Ethereum,
,Buterin is a co-founder and inventor of Ethereum, described as a ""decentralised mining network and software development platform rolled into one"",[18], that facilitates the creation of new cryptocurrencies and programs that share a single ,blockchain, (a cryptographic transaction ledger).,[19],[20],
,Buterin first described Ethereum in a white paper,[21], in late 2013. Buterin argued that bitcoin needed a scripting language for application development. But when he failed to gain agreement, he proposed development of a new platform with a more general scripting language.,[22],:,88, About the Ethereum Project, Buterin has said: ""I am truly grateful to have the opportunity to work in such an interesting and interdisciplinary area of industry, where I have the chance to interact with cryptographers, mathematicians and economists prominent in their fields, to help build software and tools that already affect tens of thousands of people around the world, and to work on advanced problems in computer science, economics and philosophy every week."",[7],
,
,Open source software,[,edit,],
,Buterin has contributed as a developer to other open source software projects.,[1], Some early examples are: Kryptokit, pybitcointools, multisig.info, and btckeysplit.,[23], He also contributed to DarkWallet,[24], by ,Cody Wilson,, ,Bitcoin, ,Python, libraries,,[25], and the ,cryptocurrency, marketplace site Egora.,[2],
,
,Ethereum Russia,[,edit,],
,As Buterin was recognizing the economic and political relevance of the Ethereum enterprise for his native Russia, he talked shortly with ,Vladimir Putin, on June 2nd 2017, at the ,St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, (SPIEF) event. The president of Russia stated that he ""supported the idea of establishing ties with possible Russian partners"".,[26],

,Drupal, ,/,ˈ,d,r,uː,p,əl,/, is ,[5], a ,free, and ,open source, ,content-management framework, written in ,PHP, and distributed under the ,GNU General Public License,.,[4],[6],[7], Drupal provides a ,back-end, framework for at least 2.3% of all ,web sites, worldwide,[8],[9], – ranging from personal ,blogs, to corporate, political, and government sites.,[10], Systems also use Drupal for ,knowledge management, and for business collaboration.,[11],
,As of  September 2018,[update],, the Drupal community comprised more than 1.3 million members,,[12],[13], including 112,500 users actively contributing,,[14], resulting in more than 41,500 free modules that extend and customize Drupal functionality,,[15], over 2,670 free themes that change the look and feel of Drupal,,[16], and at least 1,240 free distributions that allow users to quickly and easily set up a complex, use-specific Drupal in fewer steps.,[17],
,The standard release of Drupal, known as ,Drupal core,, contains basic features common to ,content-management systems,. These include user account registration and maintenance, menu management, ,RSS, feeds, taxonomy, page layout customization, and system administration. The Drupal core installation can serve as a simple Web site, a single- or multi-user blog, an ,Internet forum,, or a community Web site providing for ,user-generated content,.
,Drupal also describes itself as a ,Web application framework,.,[18], When compared with notable frameworks Drupal meets most of the generally accepted ,feature requirements, for such web frameworks.,[19],[20],[21],
,Although Drupal offers a sophisticated ,API, for developers, basic Web-site installation and administration of the framework require no programming skills.,[22],
,Drupal runs on any ,computing platform, that supports both a ,Web server, capable of running PHP and a ,database, to store content and configuration.

,
,  ,Drupal version 1-6 release history timeline,
,Originally written by ,Dries Buytaert, as a ,message board,, Drupal became an ,open source, project in 2001.,[26], The name ,Drupal, represents an English rendering of the ,Dutch, word ,druppel,, which means ""drop"" (as in a water droplet).,[27], The name came from the now-defunct Drop.org Web site, whose code slowly evolved into Drupal. Buytaert wanted to call the site ""dorp"" (Dutch for ""village"") for its community aspects, but mistyped it when checking the domain name and thought the error sounded better.,[26],
,Interest in Drupal got a significant boost in 2003 when it helped build ""DeanSpace"" for ,Howard Dean,, one of the candidates in the ,U.S. Democratic Party,'s primary campaign for the ,2004 U.S. presidential election,.  DeanSpace used open-source sharing of Drupal to support a decentralized network of approximately 50 disparate, unofficial pro-Dean websites that allowed users to communicate directly with one another as well as with the campaign.,[28], After Dean ended his campaign, members of his Web team continued to pursue their interest in developing a Web platform that could aid political activism by launching CivicSpace Labs in July 2004, ""...the first company with full-time employees that was developing and distributing Drupal technology."",[29], Other companies began to also specialize in Drupal development.,[30],[31], By 2013 the Drupal Web site listed hundreds of vendors that offered Drupal-related services.,[32],
,As of  2014,[update], Drupal is developed by a community,,[33], and its popularity is growing rapidly.,[,citation needed,], From July 2007 to June 2008 the Drupal.org site provided more than 1.4 million downloads of Drupal software, an increase of approximately 125% from the previous year.,[34],[35],
,As of  January 2017,[update], more than 1,180,000 sites use Drupal.,[36], These include hundreds of well-known organizations,,[37], including corporations, media and publishing companies, governments, non-profits,,[38], schools, and individuals.  Drupal has won several ,Packt, Open Source CMS Awards,[39], and won the ,Webware 100,[,clarification needed,], three times in a row.,[40],[41],
,Drupal 6 was released on February 13, 2008,[42],, on March 5, 2009 Buytaert announced a ,code freeze, for Drupal 7 for September 1, 2009.,[43], Drupal 7 was released on January 5, 2011, with release parties in several countries.,[44], After that, maintenance on Drupal 5 stopped, with only Drupal 7 and Drupal 6 maintained.,[45], Drupal 7 series maintenance updates are released regularly.,[46],
,On October 7, 2015 Drupal 8 first release candidate (rc1) was announced.,[47], Drupal 8 includes new features and improvements for both users and developers, including: a revamped user interface; WYSIWYG and in-place editing; improved mobile support; added and improved key contributed modules including Views, Date, and Entity Reference; introduced a new object-oriented backend leveraging Symfony components; revamped configuration management; and improved multilingual support. Drupal 8 rc1 is the collective work of over 3,200 core contributors.,[48],
,Drupal 8.0.0 was released on November 19, 2015.,[49], Subsequent major and minor releases (,8.6.3, as of November 7, 2018) which bring numerous improvements and bug fixes (including CKEditor WYSIWYG enhancements, added APIs, an improved help page) can be found on the ,Releases, page.,[50],
,
,Core,[,edit,],
,In the Drupal community, ""CORE"" refers to the collaboratively built codebase that can be extended through contributory modules and for versions prior to Drupal 8 is kept outside of the ""sites"" folder of a Drupal installation.,[51], (Starting with version 8, core is kept in its own 'core' sub-directory.) Drupal core is the stock element of Drupal. Bootstrap and Common libraries are defined as Drupal core and all other functionality is defined as Drupal modules including the system module itself.
,In a Drupal website's default configuration, authors can contribute content as either registered or anonymous users (at the discretion of the administrator). This content is accessible to web visitors through a variety of selectable criteria. As of Drupal 8, Drupal has adopted some ,Symfony, libraries into Drupal core.
,Core modules also includes a hierarchical ,taxonomy, system, which lets developers categorize content  or ,tagged, with key words for easier access.,[22],
,Drupal maintains a detailed ,changelog, of core feature updates by version.,[52],
,
,Core modules,[,edit,],
,Drupal core includes optional modules that can be enabled by the administrator to extend the functionality of the core website.,[53],
,The core Drupal distribution provides a number of features, including:,[53],
,
,
,Access statistics and logging,
,Advanced search,
,Blogs, books, comments, forums, and polls,
,Caching and feature throttling for improved performance,
,Descriptive URLs,
,Multi-level menu system,
,Multi-site support,[54],
,Multi-user content creation and editing,
,OpenID, support,
,RSS feed and feed aggregator,
,Security and new release update notification,
,User profiles,
,Various access control restrictions (user roles, IP addresses, email),
,Workflow tools (triggers and actions),
,Core themes,[,edit,],
,Drupal includes core themes, which customize the ""look and feel"" of Drupal sites,,[55], for example, Garland and Bartik.
,The Color Module, introduced in Drupal core 5.0, allows administrators to change the color scheme of certain themes via a browser interface.,[56],
,
,Localization,[,edit,],
,As of  January 2017,[update],, Drupal had been made available in 100 languages and ,English, (the default).,[57], Support is included for right-to-left languages such as ,Arabic,, ,Persian,, and ,Hebrew,.,[58],
,Drupal localization is built on top of ,gettext,, the GNU ,internationalization and localization, (i18n) library.
,
,Auto-update notification,[,edit,],
,Drupal can automatically notify the administrator about new versions of modules, themes, or the Drupal core.,[58], It's important to update quickly after security updates are released. 
,Before updating it is highly recommended to take backup of core, modules, theme, files and database. If there is any error shown after update or new updates is not compatible with a module, then it can be quickly replace by backup. There are several backup modules available in Drupal. 
,On October 15, 2014, a sql injection vulnerability was announced and update released.,[59], Two weeks later the Drupal security team released an advisory explaining that everyone should act under the assumption that any site not updated within 7 hours of the announcement are infected.,[60], Thus, it can be extremely important to apply these updates quickly and usage of a tool to make this process easier like ,drush, is highly recommended.
,
,Database abstraction,[,edit,],
,Prior to version 7, Drupal had functions that performed tasks related to databases, such as SQL query cleansing, multi-site table name prefixing, and generating proper SQL queries. In particular, Drupal 6 introduced an abstraction layer that allowed programmers to create SQL queries without writing SQL.
,Drupal 7 extends the data abstraction layer so that a programmer no longer needs to write SQL queries as text strings. It uses ,PHP Data Objects, to abstract the database. ,Microsoft, has written a database driver for their ,SQL Server,.,[61], Drupal 7 supports the file-based ,SQLite, database engine, which is part of the standard PHP distribution.
,
,Windows development,[,edit,],
,With Drupal 7's new database abstraction layer, and ability to run on the Windows web server ,IIS,, it is now easier for Windows developers to participate in the Drupal community. 
,A group on Drupal.org is dedicated to Windows issues.,[62],
,
,Accessibility,[,edit,],
,With the release of Drupal 7, ,Web accessibility, has been greatly improved by the Drupal community.,[63],  Drupal is a good framework for building sites accessible to people with disabilities, because many of the best practices have been incorporated into the program code Core. The accessibility team is carrying on the work of identifying and resolving accessibility barriers and raising awareness within the community. 
,Drupal 7 started the adoption of ,WAI-ARIA, support for ,Rich Internet Applications, and this has been carried further in Drupal 8. There have been many improvements to both the visitor and administrator sides of Drupal, especially:
,
,Drag and drop functionality,
,Improved color contrast and intensity,
,Adding skip navigation to core themes,
,Adding labels by default for input forms,
,Fixing CSS display:none with consistent methods for hiding and exposing text on focus.,
,The community also added an accessibility gate for core issues in Drupal 8.,[64],
,
,Extending the core,[,edit,],
,Drupal core is ,modular,, defining a system of ,hooks, and ,callbacks,, which are accessed internally via an ,API,.,[65], This design allows third-party contributed ,modules, and ,themes, to extend or override Drupal's default behaviors without changing Drupal core's code.
,Drupal isolates core files from contributed modules and themes. This increases flexibility and security and allows administrators to cleanly upgrade to new releases without overwriting their site's customizations.,[66], The Drupal community has the saying, ""Never hack core,"" a strong recommendation that site developers do not change core files.,[51],
,
,Modules,[,edit,],
,Contributed modules offer such additional or alternate features as image galleries, custom content types and content listings, ,WYSIWYG, editors, private messaging, third-party integration tools,,[67], integrating with BPM portals,,[68], and more. As of  January 2017,[update], the Drupal website lists more than 36,500 free ,modules,.,[15],
,Some of the most commonly used contributed modules include:,[69],
,
,Content Construction Kit (CCK): allows site administrators to dynamically create content types by extending the database schema. ""Content type"" describes the kind of information. Content types include, but are not limited to, events, invitations, reviews, articles, and products. The CCK Fields API is in Drupal core in Drupal 7.,[70],[71],
,Views: facilitates the retrieval and presentation, through a database abstraction system, of content to site visitors. Basic views functionality has been added to core in Drupal 8.,[72],
,Panels: drag and drop layout manager that allows site administrators to visually design their site.,
,Rules: conditionally executed actions based on recurring events.,
,Features: enables the capture and management of features (entities, views, fields, configuration, etc.) into custom modules.,
,Context: allows definition of sections of site where Drupal features can be conditionally activated,
,Media: makes photo uploading and media management easier,
,Services: provides an API for Drupal.,
,Organic Groups Mailing List,
,Themes,[,edit,],
,As of  January 2017,[update],, there are more than 2,400,[16], free community-contributed ,themes,. Themes adapt or replace a Drupal site's default look and feel.
,Drupal themes use standardized formats that may be generated by common third-party theme design engines. Many are written in the ,PHPTemplate, engine,[73], or, to a lesser extent, the ,XTemplate, engine.,[74], Some templates use hard-coded ,PHP,. Drupal 8 will integrate the ,Twig, templating engine.
,The inclusion of the PHPTemplate and XTemplate engines in Drupal addressed user concerns about flexibility and complexity.,[75], The Drupal theming system utilizes a ,template engine, to further separate ,HTML,/,CSS, from PHP. A popular Drupal contributed module called 'Devel' provides GUI information to developers and themers about the page build.
,Community-contributed themes,[76], at the Drupal website are released under a free ,GPL, license,,[77], and the most installed Drupal themes are ,listed on this page,.,[78],
,
,Distributions,[,edit,],
,In the past, those wanting a fully customized installation of Drupal had to download a pre-tailored version separately from the official Drupal core. Today, however, a distribution defines a packaged version of Drupal that upon installation, provides a website or application built for a specific purpose.
,The distributions offer the benefit of a new Drupal site without having to manually seek out and install third-party contributed modules or adjust configuration settings.,[79], They are collections of modules, themes, and associated configuration settings that prepare Drupal for custom operation. For example, a distribution could configure Drupal as a ""brochure"" site rather than a news site or ,online store,.
,
,Architecture,[,edit,],
,Drupal is based on the ,Presentation Abstraction Control, architecture, or PAC. 
,The ,menu system, acts as the Controller. It accepts input via a single source (,HTTP GET, and ,POST,), routes requests to the appropriate helper functions, pulls data out of the Abstraction (nodes and, from Drupal 5 onwards, forms), and then pushes it through a filter to get a Presentation of it (the theme system). 
,It even has multiple, parallel PAC agents in the form of blocks that push data out to a common canvas (page.tpl.php).,[80],
,
,Community,[,edit,],
,Drupal.org has a large community of users and developers who provide active ,community, support by coming up with new updates to help improve the functionality of Drupal,,[81], As of  January 2017,[update], more than 105,400 users are actively contributing.,[14], The semiannual DrupalCon conference alternates between North America, Europe and Asia.,[82], Attendance at DrupalCon grew from 500 at ,Szeged, in August 2008, to over 3,700 people at Austin, Texas in June, 2014.
,Smaller events, known as ""Drupal Camps"" or DrupalCamp,,[83], occur throughout the year all over the world. The annual Florida DrupalCamp brings users together for ,Coding for a Cause, that benefits a local nonprofit organization, as does the annual GLADCamp (,Greater Los Angeles Drupal, Camp) event, ,Coders with a Cause,.
,The Drupal community also organizes professional and semi-professional gatherings called ,meetups, at a large number of venues around the world. In July, 2013, ,Droplabs,, a co-working space in Los Angeles, California, was recognized as the world's ""Top Drupal Location,[84],"" (with 62 recorded events) when compared with other event venues over a 12-month period.
,There are a number of active Drupal forums,,[85], mailing lists,[86], and discussion groups.,[87], Drupal also maintains several ,IRC, channels,[88], on the ,Freenode, network.
,There are over 30 national communities,[89], around drupal.org offering language-specific support.
,Notable Drupal users include ,NBC,, ,Taboola,, ,Patch,, and ,We the People,.,[90],
,
,Security,[,edit,],
,Drupal's policy is to announce the nature of each security vulnerability once the fix is released.,[91],[92],
,Administrators of Drupal sites are automatically notified of these new releases via the Update Status module (Drupal 6) or via the Update Manager (Drupal 7).,[93], 
,Drupal maintains a security announcement mailing list, a history of all security advisories,,[94], a security team home page,,[95], and an RSS feed,[96], with the most recent security advisories.
,In mid-October 2014,,[97], Drupal issued a ""highly critical"" security advisory regarding an ,SQL injection, bug in Drupal 7, also known as Drupalgeddon.,[98],[99],  
,Downloading and installing an upgrade to Drupal 7.32 fixes the vulnerability, but does not remove any ,backdoor, installed by hackers if the site has already been ,compromised,.,[100],  Attacks began soon after the vulnerability was announced. According to the Drupal security team, where a site was not patched within hours of the announcement, it should be considered compromised and taken offline by being replaced with a static HTML page while the administrator of its server must be told that other sites on the same server may also have been compromised. 
,To solve the problem, the site must be restored using backups from before October 15, be patched and manually updated, and anything merged from the site must be audited.,[101],
,In late March 2018, a patch for vulnerability ,CVE,-2018-7600, also dubbed ,Drupalgeddon2,, was released. The underlying bug allows remote attackers without special roles or permissions to take complete control of Drupal 6, 7, and 8 sites. Starting early April, large scale automated attacks against vulnerable sites were observed,,[102], and on April 20th, a high level of penetration of unpatched sites was reported.,[103],
,
,Criticism,[,edit,],
,This section needs to be ,updated,., Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.,  ,(December 2014),
,In an article,[104], about the adoption of Drupal by the Whitehouse.gov site, ,Slate, associate editor Chris Wilson,[105], lists some common criticisms of Drupal. Other criticisms have included:
,
,Usability:, Aspects of the Drupal 6 administration interface were confusing and intimidating to some, particularly for new administrators.,[106],[107],[108], According to Dries Buytaert, Drupal 7 addressed 90% of the problems identified by usability tests conducted at the Universities of Minnesota and Baltimore.,[109],[110], To achieve this, ,Acquia, (the company founded by the project lead of Drupal) hired ,user experience, designer Mark Boulton to work with the Drupal community to design an improved user interface for Drupal's administration interface.,[111], The majority of his team's design work has been implemented by the community in Drupal 7. The 2011 usability test results from the University of Minnesota Office of Information Technology show that all of the major usability problems identified in Drupal 6 are either vastly improved or non-existent in Drupal 7. However, some new usability problems were identified.,[112],[113], Since the release of Drupal 7 there are now various distributions and applications to enhance the Back-end Usability of Drupal such as Drupal Gardens,,[114], Open Enterprise,[115], and Mitkom Builder.,[116],
,Learning curve:, Some users describe Drupal as being difficult to master.,[117],[118], Drupal's many contributed modules can have overlapping functionality and have been reported as overwhelming to new users.,[119],
,Backward compatibility (for software development):, Prior to 7, Drupal did not commit to backward compatibility across major revisions.,[120], This means that module and theme developers may have to rework their code to make it compatible. However, Drupal's policy is to not change how it uses data. This means that data from previous versions is still usable without alteration in the new release.,[121],[122], Drupal documents any incompatibilities, allowing the user to make informed decisions about when and whether to upgrade. Upgrades from 8 to 9 and beyond will require substantially less effort."" ,[123],
,Performance/scalability:, In 2008, ,performance, tests between Drupal 6.1 and ,Joomla, 1.5 demonstrated that Drupal's pages were delivered ""significantly faster"" than those of Joomla.,[124], Despite this, arguments over speed persist.,[125], Drupal is likely to be slower than a special-purpose application for a given task. For example, ,WordPress, typically outperforms Drupal as a single-user blogging tool. Drupal positions itself for broader applications requirements that are outside the scope of more narrowly focused applications.,[126], Drupal offers ,caching, to store various page elements, the use of which resulted in a 508% improvement in one benchmark.,[127], When using Drupal's default Page Cache mechanism, the cached pages are delivered only to anonymous users, so contributed modules must be installed to allow caching content for logged in users.,[128],[129], Like performance, ,scalability, (the ability to add servers to handle growing numbers of visitors with consistent response) can become a concern on large, interactive sites. ,MySQL,'s query caching can help reduce the load on the database server caused by Drupal's high ,query rate,.,[130],[131], Drupal caches database schema ,metadata, as well as elements such as blocks, forms and menus.,[132], Drupal 7 increases performance in database queries and reduces PHP code usage.,[133],
,Integrability with hosting structures:, Because of Drupal's demanding query requirements, Drupal-based websites can quickly become very taxing to hosts whose databases reside on a machine separate from their ,HTTP server,. While the issue can normally be addressed by implementing aggressive ,caching, as described above, such methods may be unimplementable in cases where the host does not offer access to ,PHP accelerators, like ,XCache, or ,APC,. Drupal has plugins that facilitate similar caching without requiring special PHP extensions.,[134],[135],
,The Drupal core search is ineffective at searching content:,[,citation needed,], There are contributed modules that will greatly improve the search functionality on a Drupal website, but they are not easily accessible due to a high learning curve and the difficulty users have in general of finding the right module.,[,citation needed,], One of the faceted search options is ,Apache Solr, Search Integration module, however, the module requires a dedicated server or ,virtual private server, (VPS) to operate because Solr must run on a ,servlet, container, e.g. ,Tomcat,, ,Jetty, or ,Resin,. These requirements make it harder for a Drupal website to have a functional search feature. In response some companies have created Apache Solr ,SaaS, products.,
,Many published, yet incomplete or outdated modules,[136], While Drupal's site boasts over 30,000 downloadable modules, searching the Drupal module directory finds many that are incomplete abandoned projects and do not work at all, only work for an outdated version due to lack of backward compatibility, or are unusable due to serious bugs.  This is due to the open source nature of Drupal, and the fact that anyone is free to start a module and publish it on drupal.org.  Modules with an active maintenance team are often highly polished, secure, and nearly bug free. Recent changes to the drupal.org website now let users search for modules, themes, and distributions, while filtering results by stability. ,[137],
,Difficult to unit test:,[138], Drupal 7 doesn't follow MVC framework and stores all of its configurations in database and as a result, unit testing the code without touching the database becomes extremely difficult. As a result, developers have resorted to using integration testing frameworks such as Red Test or behavior-driven development framework such as Behat and Codeception. Drupal 8 has taken a great stride in making it easier for developers to write unit-testable code.,
,There have also been criticism that Drupal is moving closer to the Enterprise Market and leaving smaller sites behind. The ,Backdrop CMS, project was forked by Nate Haug and Jen Lampton from Drupal about 2 years into the Drupal 8 development cycle. They claimed that Drupal was moving ""closer to the Enterprise market"" and that many in the community wouldn't be able (or willing) to make the jump. At that time the code was quite similar to that of Drupal 7—it was before the adoption of ,Symfony,, before the removal of much code that was not ,object-oriented,, and before widespread rewrites of many subsystems. ,[139],

,This article is about the class of text editors. For the most popular current example, see ,GNU Emacs,.,
,Emacs,Editing multiple ,Dired, buffers in ,GNU Emacs,Developer(s),David A. Moon,Guy L. Steele Jr.,Richard M. Stallman,Initial release,1976,; 42 years ago, (,1976,),[1],[2],Stable release,26.1 ,(May 28, 2018,; 6 months ago, (,2018-05-28,),), ,[±],
,Written in,Lisp,, ,C,Operating system,Cross-platform,Type,Text editor,Website,www,.gnu,.org,/software,/emacs,/,
,Emacs, ,/,ˈ,iː,m,æ,k,s,/, is a family of ,text editors, that are characterized by their ,extensibility,.,[3], The manual for the most widely used variant,,[4], ,GNU Emacs,, describes it as ""the extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor"".,[5],  Development of the first Emacs began in the mid-1970s, and work on its direct descendant, GNU Emacs, continues actively as of  2018,[update],.
,Emacs has over 10,000 built-in commands (many of which are macros themselves) and its ,user interface, allows the user to combine these commands into ,macros, to automate work. Implementations of Emacs typically feature a dialect of the ,Lisp, programming language that provides a deep extension capability, allowing users and developers to write new commands and applications for the editor. Extensions have been written to ,manage email,, ,files,, ,outlines,, and ,RSS, feeds,,[6], as well as clones of ,ELIZA,, ,Pong,, ,Conway's Life,, ,Snake, and ,Tetris,.,[7],
,The original EMACS was written in 1976 by ,Carl Mikkelsen,, ,David A. Moon, and ,Guy L. Steele Jr., as a set of ,Editor MACroS, for the ,TECO, editor.,[2],[8],[9],[10],[11], It was inspired by the ideas of the TECO-macro editors TECMAC and TMACS.,[12],
,The most popular, and most ported, version of Emacs is GNU Emacs, which was created by ,Richard Stallman, for the ,GNU Project,.,[13], ,XEmacs, is a variant that ,branched, from GNU Emacs in 1991. GNU Emacs and XEmacs use similar Lisp dialects and are for the most part compatible with each other.
,Emacs is, along with ,vi,, one of the two main contenders in the traditional ,editor wars, of ,Unix, culture. Emacs is among the oldest ,free and open source, projects still under development.,[14],

,History,[,edit,],
,  ,Editing ,C, ,source code, in ,GNU Emacs,
,  ,Editing, compiling and executing ,C++, code from ,GNU Emacs,
,  ,The interface of Emacs was influenced by the design of the ,Symbolics, ,space-cadet keyboard,[15],
,Emacs development began during the 1970s at the ,MIT AI Lab,, whose ,PDP-6, and ,PDP-10, computers used the ,Incompatible Timesharing System, (ITS) ,operating system, that featured a default ,line editor, known as ,Tape Editor and Corrector, (TECO). Unlike most modern text editors, TECO used separate modes in which the user would either add text, edit existing text, or display the document. One could not place characters directly into a document by typing them into TECO, but would instead enter a character ('i') in the TECO command language telling it to switch to input mode, enter the required characters, during which time the edited text was not displayed on the screen, and finally enter a character (<esc>) to switch the editor back to command mode. (A similar technique was used to allow overtyping.) This behavior is similar to that of the program ,ed,.
,Richard Stallman, visited the ,Stanford AI Lab, in 1972 or 1974 and saw the lab's ,E, editor, written by Fred Wright.,[16], He was impressed by the editor's intuitive ,WYSIWYG, (What You See Is What You Get) behavior, which has since become the default behavior of most modern text editors. He returned to MIT where Carl Mikkelsen, a ,hacker, at the AI Lab, had added to TECO a combined display/editing mode called ,Control-R, that allowed the screen display to be updated each time the user entered a keystroke. Stallman reimplemented this mode to run efficiently and then added a ,macro, feature to the TECO display-editing mode that allowed the user to redefine any keystroke to run a TECO program.,[10],
,E had another feature that TECO lacked: random-access editing. TECO was a page-sequential editor that was designed for editing ,paper tape, on the ,PDP-1, and typically allowed editing on only one page at a time, in the order of the pages in the file. Instead of adopting E's approach of structuring the file for page-random access on disk, Stallman modified TECO to handle large buffers more efficiently and changed its file-management method to read, edit, and write the entire file as a single buffer. Almost all modern editors use this approach.
,The new version of TECO quickly became popular at the AI Lab and soon accumulated a large collection of custom macros whose names often ended in ,MAC, or ,MACS,, which stood for ,macro,. Two years later, ,Guy Steele, took on the project of unifying the diverse macros into a single set.,[17], Steele and Stallman's finished implementation included facilities for extending and documenting the new macro set.,[10], The resulting system was called EMACS, which stood for ,Editing MACroS, or, alternatively, ,E with MACroS,. Stallman picked the name Emacs ""because <E> was not in use as an abbreviation on ITS at the time."",[18], An apocryphal ,hacker koan, alleges that the program was named after ,Emack & Bolio's,, a popular ,Cambridge, ice cream store.,[19], The first operational EMACS system existed in late 1976.,[20],
,Stallman saw a problem in too much customization and ,de facto, forking and set certain conditions for usage.,[,citation needed,], He later wrote:,[20],
,
,""EMACS was distributed on a basis of communal sharing, which means all improvements must be given back to me to be incorporated and distributed."",
,The original Emacs, like TECO, ran only on the PDP-10 running ITS. Its behavior was sufficiently different from that of TECO that it could be considered a text editor in its own right, and it quickly became the standard editing program on ITS. ,Mike McMahon, ,ported, Emacs from ITS to the ,TENEX, and ,TOPS-20, operating systems. Other contributors to early versions of Emacs include ,Kent Pitman,, ,Earl Killian,, and ,Eugene Ciccarelli,. By 1979, Emacs was the main editor used in MIT's AI lab and its Laboratory for Computer Science.,[21],
,
,Other early implementations,[,edit,],
,In the following years, programmers wrote a variety of Emacs-like editors for other computer systems. These included ,EINE, (,EINE Is Not EMACS,) and ,ZWEI,[22], (,ZWEI Was EINE Initially,), which were written for the ,Lisp machine, by ,Mike McMahon, and ,Daniel Weinreb,, and Sine (,Sine Is Not Eine,),,[23], which was written by Owen Theodore Anderson. Weinreb's ,EINE, was the first Emacs written in Lisp. In 1978, ,Bernard Greenberg, wrote ,Multics Emacs, almost entirely in Multics Lisp at ,Honeywell,'s Cambridge Information Systems Lab. Multics Emacs was later maintained by ,Richard Soley,, who went on to develop the NILE Emacs-like editor for the NIL Project, and by Barry Margolin. Many versions of Emacs, including GNU Emacs, would later adopt Lisp as an extension language.
,James Gosling,, who would later invent ,NeWS, and the ,Java programming language,, wrote ,Gosling Emacs, in 1981. The first Emacs-like editor to run on ,Unix,, Gosling Emacs was written in ,C, and used ,Mocklisp,, a language with Lisp-like syntax, as an extension language.
,
,GNU Emacs,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,GNU Emacs,
,  ,GNU Emacs, running in a ,text console,
,  ,GNU Emacs running on ,Microsoft Windows,
,Richard Stallman began work on GNU Emacs in 1984 to produce a ,free software, alternative to the proprietary Gosling Emacs. GNU Emacs was initially based on Gosling Emacs, but Stallman's replacement of its Mocklisp interpreter with a true Lisp interpreter required that nearly all of its code be rewritten. This became the first program released by the nascent GNU Project. GNU Emacs is written in C and provides ,Emacs Lisp,, also implemented in C, as an extension language. Version 13, the first public release, was made on March 20, 1985. The first widely distributed version of GNU Emacs was version 15.34, released later in 1985. Early versions of GNU Emacs were numbered as ,1.x.x,, with the initial digit denoting the version of the C core. The ,1, was dropped after version 1.12, as it was thought that the major number would never change, and thus the numbering skipped from ,1, to ,13,.,[24], In September 2014, it was announced on the GNU emacs-devel mailing list that GNU Emacs would adopt a ,rapid release, strategy and version numbers would increment more quickly in the future.,[25],
,GNU Emacs was later ported to Unix. It offered more features than Gosling Emacs, in particular a full-featured Lisp as its extension language, and soon replaced Gosling Emacs as the ,de facto, Unix Emacs editor. ,Markus Hess, exploited a security flaw in GNU Emacs' email subsystem in his 1986 cracking spree in which he gained ,superuser, access to Unix computers.,[26],
,GNU Emacs uses a layered architecture, with a ,Turing complete, language running on top of a smaller central core.  Because about 70% of GNU Emacs is written in the Elisp extension language,,[27], and the set of features implemented in Elisp code are automatically present once the C core (which implements the Elisp interpreter, weighing 247 kLOC as of version 24.4) has been ported, porting Emacs to a new platform is considerably less difficult than porting an equivalent project consisting of native code only.  Theoretically, only the core must be ported to the new platform; once the core is ported, the portions implemented in the language above take minimal work to bring over.
,GNU Emacs development was relatively closed until 1999 and was used as an example of the ,Cathedral, development style in ,The Cathedral and the Bazaar,. The project has since adopted a public development mailing list and anonymous ,CVS, access. Development took place in a single CVS trunk until 2008 and was then switched to the Bazaar ,DVCS,. On November 11, 2014, development was moved to ,Git,.,[28],
,Richard Stallman has remained the principal maintainer of GNU Emacs, but he has stepped back from the role at times. Stefan Monnier and Chong Yidong were maintainers from 2008-2015.,[29],[30], John Wiegley was named maintainer in 2015 after a meeting with Stallman at MIT.,[31], As of early 2014, GNU Emacs has had 579 individual ,committers, throughout its history.,[32],
,
,XEmacs,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,XEmacs,
,  ,XEmacs, 21.5 on ,GNU,/,Linux,
,Lucid Emacs, based on an early alpha version of GNU Emacs 19, was developed beginning in 1991 by ,Jamie Zawinski, and others at ,Lucid Inc., One of the best-known early forks in ,free software, development occurred when the codebases of the two Emacs versions diverged and the separate development teams ceased efforts to merge them back into a single program.,[33], Lucid Emacs has since been renamed ,XEmacs, and remains the second most popular variety of Emacs, after GNU Emacs.,[,citation needed,], XEmacs development has slowed, with the most recent stable version 21.4.22 released in January 2009 (while a beta was released in 2013), while GNU Emacs has implemented many formerly XEmacs-only features. This has led some users to proclaim XEmacs' death.,[34],
,
,Other forks of GNU Emacs,[,edit,],
,Other forks, less known than XEmacs, include:
,
,Remacs – a port of GNU Emacs to the ,Rust, programming language.,[35],
,Meadow, – a Japanese version for Microsoft Windows,[36],
,SXEmacs, – Steve Youngs' fork of XEmacs,[37],
,Aquamacs, – based on GNU Emacs (Aquamacs 3.2 is based on GNU Emacs version 24 and Aquamacs 3.3 is based on GNU Emacs version 25) which focuses on integrating with the Apple Macintosh user interface,
,Various Emacs editors,[,edit,],
,  ,The ,mg, tiny Emacs-like editor in ,OpenBSD, 5.3. Editing ,Ruby, ,source code,
,  ,Zmacs,, an Emacs for ,Lisp machines,
,In the past, projects aimed at producing small versions of Emacs proliferated. GNU Emacs was initially targeted at computers with a 32-bit flat address space and at least 1 ,MiB, of RAM.  Such computers were high end ,workstations, and ,minicomputers, in the 1980s, and this left a need for smaller reimplementations that would run on common ,personal computer, hardware.  In more recent times, small clones have been designed to fit on software installation disks.,[,citation needed,],
,Other projects aim to implement Emacs in a different dialect of Lisp or a different programming language altogether.  Although not all are still actively maintained, these clones include:
,
,MicroEMACS,, which was originally written by Dave Conroy and further developed by Daniel Lawrence and which exists in many variations.,
,mg,, originally called MicroGNUEmacs and, later, mg2a, a public-domain offshoot of MicroEMACS intended to more closely resemble GNU Emacs. Now installed by default on ,OpenBSD,.,
,NotGNU,,[38], a small, fast, proprietary ,freeware, implementation for DOS, Win16, Win32 and Linux by Julie Melbin.,
,JOVE, (Jonathan's Own Version of Emacs), Jonathan Payne's non-programmable Emacs implementation for ,UNIX-like, systems.,
,MINCE, (MINCE Is Not Complete Emacs), a version for CP/M and later DOS, from ,Mark of the Unicorn,. MINCE evolved into Final Word, which eventually became the Borland ,Sprint, word processor.,
,Perfect Writer,, a ,CP/M, implementation derived from MINCE that was included circa 1982 as the default word processor with the very earliest releases of the Kaypro II and Kaypro IV. It was later provided with the Kaypro 10 as an alternative to ,WordStar,.,
,Freemacs,, a ,DOS, version that uses an extension language based on text macro expansion and fits within the original 64 ,KiB, flat memory limit.,
,Zile,. Zile was a recursive acronym for ,Z,ile ,I,s ,L,ossy, ,E,macs,,,[39], but the project was rewritten in ,Lua, and now gives the expansion as Zile Implements Lua Editors. The new Zile still includes an implementation of Emacs in Lua called Zemacs. There is also an implementation of vi called Zi.,
,Zmacs,, for the MIT ,Lisp Machine, and its descendants, implemented in ,ZetaLisp,.,
,Climacs,, a Zmacs-influenced variant implemented in ,Common Lisp,.,
,QEmacs,,,[40], a small editor by ,Fabrice Bellard, with UTF-8 capability that can quickly edit files as large as hundreds of MiB in size.,
,Epsilon,,,[41], an Emacs clone by Lugaru Software. Versions for DOS, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X and O/S 2 are bundled in the release. It uses a non-Lisp extension language with C syntax and used a very early concurrent command shell buffer implementation under the single-tasking MS-DOS.,
,PceEmacs, is the Emacs-based editor for ,SWI-Prolog,.,
,EmACT,, a 1986 fork of MicroEmacs by Christian Jullien. EmACT,[42], source code is available at SourceForge.,
,Amacs,, an Apple II ProDOS version of Emacs implemented in 6502 assembly by ,Brian Fox,.,[43],[44],
,Hemlock,, originally written in ,Spice Lisp,, then ,Common Lisp,. A part of ,CMU Common Lisp,. Influenced by ,Zmacs,. Later forked by Lucid Common Lisp (as Helix), ,LispWorks, and ,Clozure CL, projects. There is also a Portable Hemlock project, which aims to provide a Hemlock, which runs on several Common Lisp implementations.,
,umacs,,,[45], an implementation under ,OS-9,
,Editors with Emacs emulation,[,edit,],
,Yi,, an editor that is written and extensible in ,Haskell, and has an emulation mode for Emacs.,
,Joe's Own Editor, emulates Emacs keybindings when invoked as ,jmacs,.,
,JED, has an emulation mode for Emacs.,
,Eclipse (IDE), provides a set of Emacs keybindings.,
,IntelliJ IDEA, provides a set of Emacs keybindings.,
,Epsilon (text editor), Defaults to Emacs emulation and supports a vi mode.,
,The ,Cocoa text system, uses some of the same terminology and understands many Emacs navigation bindings. This is possible because the native UI uses the ,Command key, (equivalent to Super) instead of the ,Control key,.,[46],
,Sublime Text, can emulate some of Emacs' behavior with the SublemacsPro plugin.,[47],
,Visual Studio Emacs Keys, provides a set of Emacs keybindings for Visual Studio users,
,GNU Readline, is a ,line editor, that understands the standard Emacs navigation keybindings. It also has a ,vi, emulation mode.,
,GNOME Builder, has an emulation mode for Emacs.,
,Features,[,edit,],
,Emacs is primarily a ,text editor, and is designed for manipulating pieces of text, although it is capable of formatting and printing documents like a ,word processor, by interfacing with external programs such as ,LaTeX,, ,Ghostscript, or a web browser. Emacs provides commands to manipulate and ,differentially display, ,semantic, units of text such as ,words,, ,sentences,, ,paragraphs, and ,source code, constructs such as ,functions,. It also features ,keyboard macros, for performing user-defined batches of editing commands.
,GNU Emacs is a ,real-time display, editor, as its edits are displayed onscreen as they occur. This is standard behavior for modern text editors but EMACS was among the earliest to implement this functionality instead of having to issue a separate command to insert new edits into the existing text as in vi.
,
,General architecture,[,edit,],
,Almost all of the functionality in Emacs, including basic editing operations such as the insertion of characters into a document, is achieved through ,functions, written in ,Emacs Lisp, (ELisp), a dialect of the ,Lisp programming language,. The ELisp layer sits atop a stable core of basic services and platform abstraction written in the ,C programming language,. In this Lisp environment, ,variables, and ,functions, can be modified with no need to recompile or restart Emacs.
,Emacs operates on ,data structures, called ,buffers, containing text with additional attributes; every buffer maintains its own ,point, (cursor location) and ,mark, (another location, delimiting the selected ,region, together with the ,point,), the name of the file it is ,visiting, (if applicable) and the set of active ,modes, (exactly one ,major mode,[,clarification needed,], and any number of ,minor modes,[,clarification needed,],), which control editor behaviour through variables. Elisp code can be executed interactively through named ,commands,, which can be bound to key presses or accessed by name; some commands evaluate arbitrary Elisp code from buffers (e.g. ,eval-region, or ,eval-buffer,).
,Buffers are displayed in ,windows,, which are tiled portions of the terminal screen or the GUI window (called a ,frame, in Emacs terms; multiple frames are possible). Unless configured otherwise, windows include scroll bars, line numbers, a ,header line, at the top (usually displaying the buffer title or filename) and a ,mode line, at the bottom (usually listing the active modes and point position of the buffer).
,Multiple windows can be opened onto the same buffer, for example to see different parts of a long text, and multiple buffers can share the same text, for example to take advantage of different major modes in a mixed-language file. The mode can also be changed manually as needed with ,M-x <mode name>,.
,
,Customizability,[,edit,],
,Keystrokes can be recorded into macros and replayed to automate complex, repetitive tasks. This is often done on an ad-hoc basis, with each macro discarded after use, although macros can be saved and invoked later.,
,At startup, Emacs executes an Emacs Lisp script named ,~/.emacs, (recent versions also look for ,~/emacs.el, and ,~/.emacs.d/init.el,;,[48], Emacs will execute the first one it finds, ignoring the rest). This personal customization file can be arbitrarily long and complex, but typical content includes:
,Setting global variables or invoking functions to customize Emacs behaviour, for example ,(set-default-coding-systems 'utf-8),
,Key bindings, to override standard ones and to add shortcuts for commands that the user finds convenient but don't have a key binding by default. Example: ,(global-set-key (kbd ""C-x C-b"") 'ibuffer),
,Loading, enabling and initializing extensions (Emacs comes with many extensions, but only a few are loaded by default.),
,Configuring ,event hooks, to run arbitrary code at specific times, for example to automatically recompile source code after saving a buffer (,after-save-hook,),
,Executing arbitrary files, usually to split an overly long configuration file into manageable and homogeneous parts (,~/.emacs.d/, and ,~/elisp/, are traditional locations for these personal scripts),
,The ,customize, extension allows the user to set configuration properties such as the color scheme interactively, from within Emacs, in a more user-friendly way than by setting variables in ,.emacs,: it offers search, descriptions and help text, multiple choice inputs, reverting to defaults, modification of the running Emacs instance without reloading, and other conveniences similar to the ,preferences, functionality of other programs. The customized values are saved in ,.emacs, (or another designated file) automatically.,
,Themes,, affecting the choice of fonts and colours, are defined as elisp files and chosen through the customize extension.,
,Self-documenting,[,edit,],
,The first Emacs contained a ,help, library that included documentation for every command, variable and internal function. Because of this, Emacs proponents described the software as ,self-documenting, in that it presents the user with information on its normal features and its current state. Each function includes a documentation string that is displayed to the user on request, a practice that subsequently spread to programming languages including ,Lisp,, ,Java,, ,Perl,, and ,Python,. This help system can take users to the actual code for each function, whether from a built-in library or an added third-party library.
,Emacs also has a built-in ,tutorial,. Emacs displays instructions for performing simple editing commands and invoking the tutorial when it is launched with no file to edit. The tutorial is by Stuart Cracraft and Richard Stallman.
,
,Culture,[,edit,],
,Church of Emacs,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Editor war,
,  ,Richard Stallman, as St I,GNUcius,, a saint in the ,Church of Emacs,
,The ,Church of Emacs,, formed by ,Richard Stallman,, is a ,parody religion, created for Emacs users.,[49], While it refers to ,vi, as the ,editor of the beast, (vi-vi-vi being ,6-6-6, in Roman numerals), it does not oppose the use of vi; rather, it calls ,proprietary software, ,anathema,. (""Using a ,free, version of vi is not a sin but a ,penance,."",[50],) The Church of Emacs has its own ,newsgroup,, ,alt.religion.emacs,,,[51], that has posts purporting to support this parody religion. Supporters of vi have created an opposing ,Cult of vi,.
,Stallman has jokingly referred to himself as ,St I ,GNU, cius,, a saint in the Church of Emacs.,[52],
,
,Emacs pinky,[,edit,],
,There is folklore attributing a ,repetitive strain injury, colloquially called ,Emacs ,pinky, to Emacs' strong dependence on modifier keys,,[53], although there have not been any studies done to show Emacs causes more such problems than other keyboard-heavy computer programs.
,Users have addressed this through various approaches. Some users recommend simply using the two Control keys on typical PC keyboards like Shift keys while touch typing to avoid overly straining the left pinky.,[54], Software-side methods include:,[55],
,
,Customizing the key layout so that the Control key is transposed with the caps lock key.,[56], Similar techniques include defining the caps lock key as an additional Control key or transposing the Control and Meta keys.,This technique has also been specifically recommended ,against, as ,contributing, to Emacs pinky.,[,clarification needed,],
,Software, such as xwrits or the built-in ,type-break-mode, in Emacs, that reminds the user to take regularly scheduled breaks.,
,Using the ErgoEmacs keybindings (with minor mode ,ergoemacs-mode,).,[57],[58],
,Customizing the whole keyboard layout to move statistically frequent Emacs keys to more appropriate places.,[59],
,Packages such as ,ace-jump-mode,[60], or elisp extensions that provide similar functionality of tiered navigation, first asking for a character then replacing occurrences of the character with access keys for cursor movement.,
,evil-mode,, an advanced ,Vim, emulation layer.,
,god-mode,, which provides an approach similar to vim's with a mode for entering Emacs commands without modifier keys.,
,Using customized key layout offered by ,Spacemacs,, a project where ,Space, key is used as the main key for initiating control sequences. The project also heavily incorporates both ,evil-mode, and ,god-mode,.,[61],
,StickyKeys,, which turns key sequences into key combinations.,[62],
,Emacs' built-in ,viper-mode, that allows use of the ,vi, key layout for basic text editing and the Emacs scheme for more advanced features.,[63],
,Giving a dual role to a more-comfortably accessed key such as the ,Space bar, so that it functions as a Control key when pressed in combination with other keys. ,Ergonomic keyboards, or keyboards with a greater number of keys adjacent to the space bar, such as ,Japanese keyboards,, allow thumb control of other modifier keys too like Meta or Shift.,[64],
,Using a limited ergonomic subset of keybindings, and accessing other functionality by typing ,M-x <command-name>,. M-x itself can also be rebound.,
,Driving Emacs through voice input.,
,Hardware solutions include special keyboards such as ,Kinesis's Contoured Keyboard,, which places the modifier keys where they can easily be operated by the ,thumb,, or the ,Microsoft Natural keyboard,, whose large modifier keys are placed symmetrically on both sides of the keyboard and can be pressed with the palm of the hand.,[53], Foot pedals can also be used.
,The ,Emacs pinky, is a relatively recent development. The ,Space-cadet keyboard, on which Emacs was developed had oversized Control keys that were adjacent to the space bar and were easy to reach with the thumb.,[65],
,
,Terminology,[,edit,],
,The word ,emacs, is sometimes pluralized as ,emacsen,, by phonetic analogy with ,boxen, and ,VAXen,, referring to different varieties of Emacs.,[66],
,
,Emacs in popular culture,[,edit,],
,In the movie, ,The Internship (2013),, at 01:21:01, Nick Campbell asks, ""It occurred to me, why not use Emacs rather than vi as the default editor for Ubuntu?"" to which Dana replies, ""That's actually a very good thought, Nick."",[67],
,On the television series, ,Silicon Valley Season 3, episode 6,, Richard asks, ""I mean, why not just use Vim over Emacs?"", to which Winnie replies, ""I do use Vim over Emacs."", to which Richard responds, ""Oh, God, help us!"",[68],

,Ethereum, is an ,open-source,, ,public,, ,blockchain,-based ,distributed computing, platform and ,operating system, featuring ,smart contract, (scripting) functionality. It supports a modified version of ,Nakamoto, consensus via transaction-based state transitions.
,Ether, is a ,cryptocurrency, whose blockchain is generated by the Ethereum platform. ,Ether, can be transferred between accounts and used to compensate participant mining nodes for computations performed.,[3], Ethereum provides a decentralized ,virtual machine,, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which can execute scripts using an international network of public nodes. The virtual machine's ,instruction set,, in contrast to others like ,Bitcoin, ,Script,, is ,expressive, enough as languages like ,C, that it's said to be ,Turing-complete, in an informal sense. ""Gas"", an internal transaction pricing mechanism, is used to mitigate ,spam, and allocate resources on the network.
,Ethereum was proposed in late 2013 by ,Vitalik Buterin,, a cryptocurrency researcher and programmer. Development was funded by an online ,crowdsale, that took place between July and August 2014.
,The system went live on 30 July 2015, with 72 million coins ""premined"". 
This accounts for about 70 percent of the total circulating supply in 2018.
,In 2016, as a result of the exploitation of a flaw in ,The DAO, project's ,smart contract, software, and subsequent theft of $50 million worth of Ether,,[4], Ethereum was split into two separate blockchains – the new separate version became Ethereum (ETH) with the theft reversed,,[5], and the original continued as ,Ethereum Classic, (ETC).,[6],[7],
,The value of the Ethereum currency grew over 13,000 percent in 2017, to over $1400.,[8], By September 2018, it had fallen back to $200.,[9],

,Etymology,
,Vitalik Buterin picked the name Ethereum after browsing Wikipedia articles about elements and science fiction, when he found the name, noting, ""I immediately realized that I liked it better than all of the other alternatives that I had seen; I suppose it was the fact that sounded nice and it had the word ',ether,', referring to the hypothetical invisible medium that permeates the universe and allows light to travel.""
,
,History,
,Ethereum was initially described in a white paper by ,Vitalik Buterin,,,[10], a programmer involved with ,Bitcoin Magazine,, in late 2013 with a goal of building decentralized applications.,[11],[12], Buterin had argued that Bitcoin needed a ,scripting language, for application development. Failing to gain agreement, he proposed development of a new platform with a more general scripting language.,[13],:,88,
,At the time of public announcement in January 2014, the core Ethereum team was Vitalik Buterin, Mihai Alisie, Anthony Di Iorio, and Charles Hoskinson. Formal development of the Ethereum software project began in early 2014 through a ,Swiss, company, ,Ethereum Switzerland GmbH, (,EthSuisse,).,[14],[15], Subsequently, a Swiss non-profit foundation, the Ethereum Foundation (,Stiftung Ethereum,), was created as well. Development was funded by an online public ,crowdsale, during July–August 2014, with the participants buying the Ethereum value token (ether) with another digital currency, ,bitcoin,.
,While there was early praise for the technical innovations of Ethereum, questions were also raised about its security and scalability.,[11],
,
,Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA),
,In March 2017, various blockchain start-ups, research groups, and Fortune 500 companies announced the creation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) with 30 founding members.,[16], By May, the nonprofit organization had 116 enterprise members—including ,ConsenSys,, ,CME Group,, ,Cornell University's research group,, ,Toyota Research Institute,, ,Samsung SDS,, ,Microsoft,, ,Intel,, ,J. P. Morgan,, ,Cooley LLP,, ,Merck KGaA,, ,DTCC,, ,Deloitte,, ,Accenture,, ,Banco Santander,, ,BNY Mellon,, ,ING,, and ,National Bank of Canada,.,[17],[18],[19], By July 2017, there were over 150 members in the alliance, including recent additions ,MasterCard,, ,Cisco Systems,, ,Sberbank, and ,Scotiabank,.,[20],[21],

,Several codenamed prototypes of the Ethereum platform were developed by the Foundation, as part of their Proof-of-Concept series, prior to the official launch of the Frontier network. ""Olympic"" was the last of these prototypes, and public beta pre-release.
,The Olympic network provided users with a ,bug bounty, of 25,000 ether for stress testing the limits of the Ethereum blockchain. ""Frontier"" marked the tentative experimental release of the Ethereum platform in July 2015.,[22],
,Since the initial launch, Ethereum has undergone several planned protocol upgrades, which are important changes affecting the underlying functionality and/or ,incentive structures, of the platform.
,[23],[24],
,
,Protocol upgrades are accomplished by means of a ,soft fork, of the open source code base.
,
,""Homestead"" was the first to be considered ,stable,.
,It included improvements to transaction processing, gas pricing, and security
and the soft fork occurred on 31 July 2015.,[13],:,87,
,The ""Metropolis Part 1: Byzantium"" soft fork took effect on 16 October 2017, and included changes to reduce the complexity of the EVM and provide more flexibility for smart contract developers.,[24], Byzantium also adds supports for zk-SNARKs (from ,Zcash,); with the first zk-SNARK transaction occurring on testnet on September 19, 2017.
,
,The DAO event,
,Main article: ,The DAO (organization),
,In 2016 a ,decentralized autonomous organization, called ,The DAO,, a set of ,smart contracts, developed on the platform, raised a record ,US$150 million, in a ,crowdsale, to fund the project.,[25], The DAO was exploited in June when ,US$50 million, in Ether were taken by an unknown hacker.,[26],[27], The event sparked a debate in the crypto-community about whether Ethereum should perform a contentious ""hard fork"" to reappropriate the affected funds.,[28], As a result of the dispute, the network split in two. Ethereum (the subject of this article) continued on the forked blockchain, while ,Ethereum Classic, continued on the original blockchain. The hard fork created a rivalry between the two networks.
,After the hard fork related to The DAO, Ethereum subsequently forked twice in the fourth quarter of 2016 to deal with other attacks. By the end of November 2016, Ethereum had increased its ,DDoS, protection, de-bloated the blockchain, and thwarted further spam attacks by hackers.

,
,Ether, is a fundamental ,cryptocurrency, for operation of Ethereum, which thereby provides a public ,distributed ledger, for transactions. It is used to pay for gas, a unit of computation used in transactions and other state transitions. Mistakenly, this currency is also referred to as ,Ethereum,.
,It is listed under the code ETH and traded on ,cryptocurrency, exchanges, and the ,Greek, ,uppercase Xi, character (Ξ) is generally used for its ,currency symbol,. It is also used to pay for transaction fees and computational services on the Ethereum network.,[29],
,
,Characteristics,
,Further information: ,Cryptocurrency,
,As with other cryptocurrencies, the validity of each ether is provided by a ,blockchain,, which is a continuously growing list of ,records,, called ,blocks,, which are linked and secured using ,cryptography,.,[30],[31], By design, the blockchain is inherently resistant to modification of the data. It is an open, ,distributed ledger, that records transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way.,[32], Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum operates using accounts and balances in a manner called state transitions. This does not rely upon ,unspent transaction outputs, (UTXOs). State denotes the current balances of all accounts and extra data. State is not stored on the blockchain, it is stored in a separate ,Merkle, Patricia tree. A ,cryptocurrency wallet, stores the ,public and private ""keys"", or ""addresses"" which can be used to receive or spend Ether. These can be generated through BIP 39 style mnemonics for a BIP 32 ""HD Wallet"". In Ethereum, this is unnecessary as it does not operate in a UTXO scheme. With the private key, it is possible to write in the blockchain, effectively making an ether transaction.
,To send ether to an account, you need the public key of that account. Ether accounts are pseudonymous in that they are not linked to individual persons, but rather to one or more specific addresses.
,Owners can store these addresses in software, on paper and possibly in memory (""brain wallet"").
,
,Addresses,
,Ethereum addresses are composed of the prefix ""0x"", a common identifier for ,hexadecimal,, concatenated with the rightmost 20 bytes of the ,Keccak-256, hash (,big endian,) of the ,ECDSA, ,public key,. In hexadecimal, 2 digits represents a byte, meaning addresses contain 40 hexadecimal digits. One example is 0xb794F5eA0ba39494cE839613fffBA74279579268, the Poloniex ColdWallet. Contract addresses are in the same format, however they are determined by sender and creation transaction nonce.,[33], User accounts are indistinguishable from contract accounts given only an address for each and no blockchain data. Any valid Keccak-256 hash put into the described format is valid, even if it does not correspond to an account with a private key or a contract. This is unlike Bitcoin, which uses ,base58check, to ensure that addresses are properly typed.
,
,Comparison to bitcoin,
,Ether is different from ,Bitcoin, (the ,cryptocurrency, with the largest ,market capitalization, as of June 2018) in several aspects:
,
,Its ,block time, is 14 to 15 seconds, compared with 10 minutes for bitcoin.,
,Mining, of ether generates new coins at a usually consistent rate, occasionally changing during hard forks, while for bitcoin the rate halves every 4 years.,
,For proof-of-work, it uses the ,Ethash, algorithm which reduces the advantage of specialized ,ASICs, in mining.,
,Transaction fees differ by computational complexity, bandwidth use and storage needs (in a system known as gas), while bitcoin transactions compete by means of transaction size, in bytes.,
,Ethereum gas units each have a price that can be specified in a transaction. This is typically measured in Gwei. Bitcoin transactions usually have fees specified in satoshis per byte.,
,Transaction fees are generally considerably lower for ether than for Bitcoin. In December 2017, the median transaction fee for ether corresponded to $0.33, while for bitcoin it corresponded to $23.,
,Ethereum uses an account system where values in Wei are debited from accounts and credited to another, as opposed to Bitcoin's UTXO system, which is more analogous to spending cash and receiving change in return.,
,Supply,
,The total supply of ether was Ξ100 million as of June 2018. In 2017, mining generated 9.2 million new ether, corresponding to a 10% increase in its total supply. Casper FFG and CBC are expected to reduce the inflation rate to between 0.5% to 2%. There is no currently implemented hard cap on the total supply of ETH.
,
,Markets and stores,
,Ether can be traded by regular currency ,brokers,, ,cryptocurrency exchanges,, as well as many online ,cryptocurrency wallets,.,[34],
,
,Platform,
,Virtual Machine,
,The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum. It is a 256-bit register stack, designed to run the same code exactly as intended. It is the fundamental consensus mechanism for Ethereum. The formal definition of the EVM is specified in the Ethereum Yellow Paper.,[33],[35], On February 1, 2018, there were 27,500 nodes in the main Ethereum network.,[36], Ethereum Virtual Machines have been implemented in ,C++,, ,Go,, ,Haskell,, ,Java,, ,JavaScript,, ,Python,, ,Ruby,, ,Rust,, and ,WebAssembly, (currently under development).
,
,Smart contracts,
,Ethereum's ,smart contracts, are based on different computer languages, which developers use to program their own functionalities. Smart contracts are ,high-level, programming ,abstractions, that are compiled down to EVM ,bytecode, and deployed to the Ethereum blockchain for execution. They can be written in ,Solidity, (a language library with similarities to ,C, and ,JavaScript,), Serpent (similar to ,Python,, but deprecated), LLL (a ,low-level, ,Lisp,-like language), and Mutan (,Go,-based, but deprecated). There is also a research-oriented language under development called Viper (a ,strongly-typed, ,Python,-derived ,decidable language,).
,Smart contracts can be public, which opens up the possibility to prove functionality, e.g. self-contained ,provably fair, casinos.,[37],
,One issue related to using smart contracts on a public blockchain is that bugs, including security holes, are visible to all but cannot be fixed quickly.,[38], One example of this is the 17 June 2016 attack on The DAO, which could not be quickly stopped or reversed.,[26],
,There is ongoing research on how to use formal verification to express and prove non-trivial properties. A ,Microsoft Research, report noted that writing solid smart contracts can be extremely difficult in practice, using The DAO hack to illustrate this problem. The report discussed tools that Microsoft had developed for verifying contracts, and noted that a large-scale analysis of published contracts is likely to uncover widespread vulnerabilities. The report also stated that it is possible to verify the equivalence of a Solidity program and the EVM code.,[39],
,
,Applications,
,Ethereum is written in Turing complete language, which includes seven different programming languages.,[40], Developers use the language to create and publish applications which they know will run inside Ethereum.,[41],[42], It's a cumbersome system, but that's not deterring developers from writing Ethereum programs.,[43],
,Ethereum blockchain applications are usually referred to as DApps (,decentralized application,), since they are based on the decentralized Ethereum Virtual Machine, and its smart contracts.,[44], Many uses have been proposed for Ethereum platform, including ones that are impossible or unfeasible.,[45],[29], Use case proposals have included finance, the ,internet-of-things,, ,farm-to-table, produce, ,electricity sourcing and pricing,, and ,sports betting,. Ethereum is (as of 2017) the leading ,blockchain, platform for ,initial coin offering, projects, with over 50% market share.
,As of January 2018, there are more than 250 live DApps, with hundreds more under development. Some application examples include: digital signature algorithms, securitized tokens, digital rights management, crowdfunding, prediction markets, remittance, online gambling, social media platforms, financial exchanges and identity systems.
,
,Enterprise software,
,Ethereum-based customized software and networks, independent from the public Ethereum chain, are being tested by ,enterprise software, companies.,[46], Interested parties include ,Microsoft,, ,IBM,, ,JPMorgan Chase,,,[29],[47], ,Deloitte,,,[48], ,R3,,,[49], ,Innovate UK, (cross-border payments prototype).,[50], Barclays, UBS and Credit Suisse are experimenting with Ethereum blockchain to automate Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) II requirements.
,
,Permissioned ledgers,
,Ethereum-based ,permissioned blockchain, variants are used and being investigated for various projects.
,
,J. P. Morgan Chase, is developing a permissioned-variant of Ethereum blockchain dubbed ""Quorum"".,[51], It's designed to toe the line between private and public in the realm of shuffling derivatives and payments. The idea is to satisfy regulators who need seamless access to financial goings-on, while protecting the privacy of parties that don't wish to reveal their identities nor the details of their transactions to the general public.,[52],
,Royal Bank of Scotland, has announced that it has built a Clearing and Settlement Mechanism (CSM) based on the Ethereum distributed ledger and smart contract platform.,[53],[54],
,Performance,
,In Ethereum all smart contracts are stored publicly on every node of the blockchain, which has costs.,[55], Being a ,blockchain, means it is ,secure by design, and is an example of a distributed computing system with high ,Byzantine fault tolerance,. The downside is that performance issues arise in that every node is calculating all the smart contracts in real time, resulting in lower speeds.,[55], As of January 2016, the Ethereum protocol could process 25 transactions per second.,[55], In comparison, the ,Visa, payment platform processes 45,000 payments per second leading some to question the scalability of Ethereum.,[56], On 19 December 2016, Ethereum exceeded one million transactions in a single day for the first time.,[57],
,
,Micro Raiden was launched November 2017.,[58],
,Buterin and Joseph Poon (a co-author of ,Bitcoin,'s ,Lightning Network, whitepaper) announced in 2017 their plan to launch a scaling solution called Plasma which creates ""child"" blockchains to the ""main"" parent blockchain.,[59], The plasma project has skeptics; specifically, Vlad Zamfir (Ethereum's lead researcher on proof of stake) has publicly questioned the plasma project's viability.,[59],
,Ethereum engineers have been working on ,sharding, the calculations, and the next step (called Ethereum 2) was presented at Ethereum's Devcon 3 in November 2017.,[60],
,Ethereum's blockchain uses ,Merkle trees,, for security reasons, to improve scalability, and to optimize transaction hashing.,[61], As with any Merkle tree implementation, it allows for storage savings, set membership proofs (called ""Merkle proofs""), and light client synchronization. The Ethereum network has at times faced congestion problems, for example, congestion occurred during late 2017 in relation to ,Cryptokitties,.,[62],
,
,Development Governance and EIP,
,In October 2015,,[63], a development governance was proposed as ,Ethereum Improvement Proposal,, aka ,EIP,, standardized on EIP-1.,[64], The core development group and community were to gain consensus by a process regulated EIP. A few notable decisions were made in the process of EIP, such as EIP-160 (EXP cost increase caused by Spurious Dragon Hardfork),[65], and ,EIP-20 (ERC-20 Token Standard),.,[66], In January 2018, the EIP process was finalized and published as EIP-1 status turned ""active"".,[63],
,
,Criticisms,
,Izabella Kaminska, the editor of ,FT Alphaville,, has pointed out that criminals are using Ethereum to run ,Ponzi schemes, and other forms of investment fraud.,[67], The article was based on a paper from the ,University of Cagliari,, which placed the number of Ethereum smart contracts which facilitate Ponzi schemes at nearly 10% of 1384 smart contracts examined. However, it also estimated that only 0.05% of the transactions on the network were related to such contracts.,[68],

,InterPlanetary File System, (,IPFS,) is a ,protocol, and network designed to create a ,content-addressable,, ,peer-to-peer, method of storing and sharing ,hypermedia, in a ,distributed file system,.,[2], IPFS was initially designed by ,Juan Benet,, and is now an ,open-source, project developed with help from the community.,[3],[4],

,History,[,edit,],
,In 2014, the IPFS protocol took advantage of the ,Bitcoin, ,blockchain, ,protocol, and network infrastructure in order to store unalterable data, remove duplicated files across the network, and obtain address information for accessing storage nodes to search for files in the network.,[5],[2],
,Implementations in ,Go,[6], and ,JavaScript,[7], exist, and a ,Python, implementation is in progress.,[8], The Go implementation is considered to be the ,reference implementation,[9], while formal ,specifications, are developed.,[10],
,
,Overview,[,edit,],
,IPFS is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. In some ways, IPFS is similar to the ,World Wide Web,, but IPFS could be seen as a single ,BitTorrent, swarm, exchanging objects within one ,Git, repository. In other words, IPFS provides a high-throughput, content-addressed ,block storage, model, with content-addressed ,hyperlinks,.,[11], This forms a generalized ,Merkle, ,directed acyclic graph, (DAG). IPFS combines a ,distributed hash table,, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace. IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other not to tamper with data in transit.,[12], Distributed Content Delivery saves bandwidth and prevents ,DDoS attacks,, which HTTP struggles with.,[5],
,The filesystem can be accessed in a variety of ways, including via ,FUSE, and over ,HTTP,.,[11],  A local file can be added to the IPFS filesystem, making it available to the world. Files are identified by their hashes, so it's caching-friendly. They are distributed using a BitTorrent-based protocol.  Other users viewing the content aid in serving the content to others on the network.  IPFS has a name service called IPNS, a global namespace based on ,PKI,, serves to build trust chains, is compatible with other NSes and can map ,DNS,, .onion, .bit, etc. to IPNS.,[13],
,
,  ,The Wikipedia logo has an IPFS hash with the following code: QmRW3V9znzFW9M5FYbitSEvd5dQrPWGvPvgQD6LM22Tv8D. It can be accessed with that hash over HTTP by a ,public gateway, or a ,local IPFS instance,
,Merkle data format,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Merkle tree,
,Every ,Merkle, is a ,directed acyclic graph, (DAG) because each node is accessed via its name. Each branch of Merkle is the hash of its local contents, naming children by their hash instead of their full contents. So after creation there is no way to edit a node. This prevents cycles (assuming there are no ,hash collisions,), since one cannot link the first created node to the last node to create the last reference.
,In general, for any Merkle to create a new branch or verify an existing branch, a hash algorithm is used on some combination of the local contents, such as a list of child hashes and other bytes. A few different hash algorithms are available in IPFS.
,The data input to any of those hash algorithms is documented.,[14],
,
,Notable users,[,edit,],
,The ,Catalan independence referendum,, taking place in September–October 2017, was deemed illegal by the ,Constitutional Court of Spain, and many related websites were blocked. Subsequently, the Catalan Pirate Party mirrored the website on IPFS to bypass the ,High Court of Justice of Catalonia, order of blocking.,[15],[16],
,IPFS was used to create a mirror of Wikipedia, which allows people living in jurisdictions where Wikipedia is blocked to access the content of Wikipedia.,[17],  That archived version of Wikipedia is a limited immutable copy that cannot be updated.  Efforts are being made to resolve mutable (updatable) and immutable (permanent archive) systems and interfaces.,[,citation needed,],
,Filecoin,, also inter-related to IPFS and developed by ,Juan Benet, and ,Protocol Labs,, is an IPFS-based ,cooperative storage cloud,.,[18],

" 19 November 2018, at 16:13",""",Homesteading the Noosphere,"" (abbreviated ,HtN,) is an ,essay, written by ,Eric S. Raymond, about the social workings of ,open-source, ,software development,. It follows his previous piece "",The Cathedral and the Bazaar,"" (1997).
,The essay examines issues of ,project, ownership and transfer, as well as investigating possible ,anthropological, roots of the ,gift culture, in open source as contrasted with the exchange culture of ,closed source, software. Raymond also investigates the nature of the spread of open source into the untamed frontier of ideas he terms the ,noosphere,, postulating that projects that range too far ahead of their time fail because they are too far out in the wilderness, and that successful projects tend to relate to existing projects.
,Raymond delves into the contrast between the stated aims of open source and observed behaviors, and also explores the underlying motivations of people involved in the ,open source movement,. He seems to settle on the idea that open-source practitioners find striving for a great ,reputation, within the ""tribe"" a key motivational feature.

,The ,hacker culture, is a ,subculture, of individuals who enjoy the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming limitations of ,software systems, to achieve novel and clever outcomes.,[1], The act of engaging in activities (such as programming or other media,[2],) in a spirit of playfulness and exploration is termed ""hacking"". However, the defining characteristic of a ,hacker, is not the activities performed themselves (e.g. ,programming,), but the manner in which it is done,[3], and whether it is something exciting and meaningful.,[2], Activities of playful cleverness can be said to have ""hack value"" and therefore the term ""hacks"" came about,,[3], with early examples including ,pranks at MIT, done by students to demonstrate their technical aptitude and cleverness. Therefore, the hacker culture originally emerged in academia in the 1960s around the ,Massachusetts Institute of Technology, (MIT)'s ,Tech Model Railroad Club, (TMRC),[4], and ,MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,.,[5], Hacking originally involved entering restricted areas in a clever way without causing any major damages. Some famous ,hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, were placing of a campus police cruiser on the roof of the Great Dome and converting the Great Dome into ,R2-D2,.,[6],
,Richard Stallman, explains about hackers who program:

They wanted to make their programs that they used be as good as they could. They also wanted to make them do neat things. They wanted to be able to do something in a more exciting way than anyone believed possible and show ""Look how wonderful this is. I bet you didn't believe this could be done."",[7],
,
,Hackers from this subculture tend to emphatically differentiate themselves from what they pejoratively call "",crackers,""; those who are generally referred to by media and members of the general public using the term ""hacker"", and whose primary focus‍—‌be it to malign or for malevolent purposes‍—‌lies in ,exploiting, weaknesses in computer security.,[8],

,Definition,
,The ,Jargon File,, an influential but not universally accepted compendium of hacker slang, defines hacker as ""A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and stretching their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary."",[9], The ,Request for Comments, (RFC) 1392, the Internet Users' Glossary, amplifies this meaning as ""A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular."",[10],
,As documented in the Jargon File, these hackers are disappointed by the mass media and general public's usage of the word ,hacker, to refer to ,security breakers,, calling them ""crackers"" instead. This includes both ""good"" crackers ("",white hat hackers,"") who use their computer security related skills and knowledge to learn more about how systems and networks work and to help to discover and fix security holes, as well as those more ""evil"" crackers ("",black hat hackers,"") who use the same skills to author harmful software (like viruses, trojans, etc.) and illegally infiltrate secure systems with the intention of doing harm to the system.,[11], The programmer subculture of hackers, in contrast to the cracker community, generally sees computer security related activities as contrary to the ideals of the original and true meaning of the hacker term that instead related to playful cleverness.,[11],
,
,History,
,The word ""hacker"" derives from the seventeenth-century word of a ""lusty laborer"" who harvested fields by dogged and rough swings of his hoe. Although the idea of ""hacking"" has existed long before the term ""hacker""‍—‌with the most notable example of ,Lightning Ellsworth,, it was not a word that the first programmers used to describe themselves. In fact, many of the first programmers were from engineering or physics backgrounds. 
,
,

,
,“
,
,""But from about 1945 onward (and especially during the creation of the first ENIAC computer) some programmers realized that their expertise in computer software and technology had evolved not just into a profession, but into a passion"" (46).,[1],
,
,”
,
,
,
,
,There was a growing awareness of a style of programming different from the cut and dried methods employed at first,,[12],[13], but it was not until the 1960s that the term hackers began to be used to describe proficient computer programmers. Therefore, the fundamental characteristic that links all who identify themselves as hackers are ones who enjoy ""…the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming and circumventing limitations of programming systems and who tries to extend their capabilities"" (47).,[1], With this definition in mind, it can be clear where the negative implications of the word ""hacker"" and the subculture of ""hackers"" came from.
,Some common nicknames among this culture include ""crackers"" who are unskilled thieves who mainly rely on luck. Others include ""phreak""‍—‌which refers to a type of skilled ,crackers, and ""warez d00dz""‍—‌which is a kind of cracker that acquires reproductions of copyrighted software. Within all hackers are tiers of hackers such as the ""samurai"" who are hackers that hire themselves out for legal electronic locksmith work. Furthermore, there are other hackers who are hired to test security, they are called ""sneakers"" or ""tiger teams"".
,Before communications between computers and computer users were as ,networked, as they are now, there were multiple independent and parallel hacker subcultures, often unaware or only partially aware of each other's existence. All of these had certain important traits in common:
,
,Creating software and sharing it with each other,
,Placing a high value on freedom of inquiry,
,Hostility to secrecy,
,Information-sharing as both an ideal and a practical strategy,
,Upholding the right to ,fork,
,Emphasis on rationality,
,Distaste for authority,
,Playful cleverness, taking the serious humorously and humor seriously,
,  ,The ,Glider,, proposed as an ,emblem of the ""hacker community"", by ,Eric S. Raymond,.,[14],
,These sorts of subcultures were commonly found at ,academic, settings such as ,college, ,campuses,. The ,MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,, the ,University of California, Berkeley, and ,Carnegie Mellon University, were particularly well-known hotbeds of early hacker culture. They evolved in parallel, and largely unconsciously, until the ,Internet,, where a legendary ,PDP-10, machine at MIT, called AI, that was running ,ITS,, provided an early meeting point of the hacker community. This and other developments such as the rise of the ,free software movement, and ,community, drew together a critically large population and encouraged the spread of a conscious, common, and systematic ethos. Symptomatic of this evolution were an increasing adoption of ,common slang, and a shared view of history, similar to the way in which other occupational groups have professionalized themselves but without the formal credentialing process characteristic of most professional groups.,[,citation needed,],
,Over time, the academic hacker subculture has tended to become more conscious, more cohesive, and better organized. The most important consciousness-raising moments have included the composition of the first ,Jargon File, in 1973, the promulgation of the ,GNU Manifesto, in 1985, and the publication of ,Eric Raymond,'s ,The Cathedral and the Bazaar, in 1997. Correlated with this has been the gradual recognition of a set of shared culture heroes, including: ,Bill Joy,, ,Donald Knuth,, ,Dennis Ritchie,, ,Alan Kay,, ,Ken Thompson,, ,Richard M. Stallman,, ,Linus Torvalds,, ,Larry Wall,, and ,Guido Van Rossum,.
,The concentration of academic hacker subculture has paralleled and partly been driven by the commoditization of computer and networking technology, and has, in turn, accelerated that process. In 1975, hackerdom was scattered across several different families of ,operating systems, and disparate networks; today it is largely a ,Unix, and ,TCP/IP, phenomenon, and is concentrated around various ,operating systems, based on ,free software, and ,open-source software, development.
,
,Ethics and principles,
,Main article: ,Hacker ethic,
,Many of the values and tenets of the free and open source software movement stem from the ,hacker ethics, that originated at ,MIT,[15], and at the ,Homebrew Computer Club,. The hacker ethics were chronicled by Steven Levy in ,Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution,[16], and in other texts in which Levy formulates and summarizes general hacker attitudes:
,
,Access to computers-and anything that might teach you something about the way the world works-should be unlimited and total.,
,All information should be free.,
,Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.,
,You can create art and beauty on a computer.,
,Computers can change your life for the better.,
,Hacker ethics are concerned primarily with sharing, openness, collaboration, and engaging in the hands-on imperative.,[16],
,Linus Torvalds,, one of the leaders of the open source movement (known primarily for developing the ,Linux kernel,), has noted in the book ,The Hacker Ethic,[17], that these principles have evolved from the known Protestant ethics and incorporates the spirits of capitalism, as introduced in the early 20th century by ,Max Weber,.
,Hack value is the notion used by hackers to express that something is worth doing or is interesting.,[18], This is something that hackers often feel intuitively about a problem or solution.
,An aspect of hack value is performing feats for the sake of showing that they can be done, even if others think it is difficult. Using things in a unique way outside their intended purpose is often perceived as having hack value. Examples are using a ,dot matrix impact printer, to produce musical notes, using a ,flatbed scanner, to take ultra-high-resolution photographs or using an ,optical mouse, as ,barcode reader,.
,A solution or feat has ""hack value"" if it is done in a way that has finesse, cleverness or brilliance, which makes ,creativity, an essential part of the meaning. For example, ,picking a difficult lock, has hack value; smashing it does not. As another example, proving ,Fermat's last theorem, by linking together most of modern mathematics has hack value; solving a combinatorial problem by ,exhaustively trying all possibilities, does not. Hacking is not using process of elimination to find a solution; it's the process of finding a clever solution to a problem.
,
,Uses,
,While using ,hacker, to refer to someone who enjoys playful cleverness is most often applied to computer programmers, it is sometimes used for people who apply the same attitude to other fields.,[8], For example, ,Richard Stallman, describes the silent composition ,4′33″, by John Cage and the 14th-century ,palindromic, three-part piece ""Ma Fin Est Mon Commencement"" by ,Guillaume de Machaut, as hacks.,[3], According to the Jargon File,,[9], the word ,hacker, was used in a similar sense among radio amateurs in the 1950s, predating the software hacking community.
,
,Programming,
,The Boston Globe, in 1984 defined ""hackers"" as ""computer nuts"".,[19], In their programmer subculture, a hacker is a person who follows a spirit of playful cleverness and loves programming. It is found in an originally academic movement unrelated to computer security and most visibly associated with ,free software,, ,open source, and ,demoscene,. It also has a ,hacker ethic,, based on the idea that writing software and sharing the result on a voluntary basis is a good idea, and that information should be free, but that it's not up to the hacker to make it free by breaking into private computer systems. This hacker ethic was publicized and perhaps originated in ,Steven Levy,'s ,Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution, (1984). It contains a codification of its principles.
,The programmer subculture of hackers disassociates from the mass media's pejorative use of the word 'hacker' referring to computer security, and usually prefer the term 'cracker' for that meaning. Complaints about supposed mainstream misuse started as early as 1983, when media used ""hacker"" to refer to the computer criminals involved in ,The 414s, case.,[20],
,In the programmer subculture of hackers, a computer hacker is a person who enjoys designing software and building programs with a sense for aesthetics and playful cleverness. The term hack in this sense can be traced back to ""describe the elaborate college pranks that...students would regularly devise"" (Levy, 1984 p. 10). To be considered a 'hack' was an honor among like-minded peers as ""to qualify as a hack, the feat must be imbued with innovation, style and technical virtuosity"" (Levy, 1984 p. 10) The ,MIT, ,Tech Model Railroad Club, Dictionary defined hack in 1959 (not yet in a computer context) as ""1) an article or project without constructive end; 2) a project undertaken on bad self-advice; 3) an entropy booster; 4) to produce, or attempt to produce, a hack(3)"", and ""hacker"" was defined as ""one who hacks, or makes them"". Much of TMRC's jargon was later imported into early computing culture, because the club started using a ,DEC, ,PDP-1, and applied its local model railroad slang in this computing context. Initially incomprehensible to outsiders, the slang also became popular in MIT's computing environments beyond the club. Other examples of jargon imported from the club are 'losing' (""when a piece of equipment is not working""),[16], and 'munged' (""when a piece of equipment is ruined"").,[16],
,Others did not always view hackers with approval. ,MIT living groups, in 1989 avoided advertising their sophisticated ,Project Athena, workstations to prospective members because they wanted residents who were interested in people, not computers, with one fraternity member stating that ""We were worried about the hacker subculture"".,[21],
,According to ,Eric S. Raymond,,,[22], the Open Source and Free Software hacker subculture developed in the 1960s among 'academic hackers',[23], working on early ,minicomputers, in ,computer science, environments in the United States.
,Hackers were influenced by and absorbed many ideas of key technological developments and the people associated with them. Most notable is the technical culture of the pioneers of the ,Arpanet,, starting in 1969. The ,PDP-10, AI machine at MIT, running the ,ITS, operating system and connected to the Arpanet, provided an early hacker meeting point. After 1980 the subculture coalesced with the culture of ,Unix,. Since the mid-1990s, it has been largely coincident with what is now called the ,free software, and ,open source movement,.
,Many programmers have been labeled ""great hackers"",,[24], but the specifics of who that label applies to is a matter of opinion. Certainly major contributors to ,computer science, such as ,Edsger Dijkstra, and ,Donald Knuth,, as well as the inventors of popular software such as ,Linus Torvalds, (,Linux,), and ,Ken Thompson, and ,Dennis Ritchie, (,Unix, and ,C programming language,) are likely to be included in any such list; see also ,List of programmers,. People primarily known for their contributions to the consciousness of the programmer subculture of hackers include ,Richard Stallman,, the founder of the free software movement and the ,GNU project,, president of the ,Free Software Foundation, and author of the famous ,Emacs, text editor as well as the ,GNU Compiler Collection (GCC),, and ,Eric S. Raymond,, one of the founders of the ,Open Source Initiative, and writer of the famous text ,The Cathedral and the Bazaar, and many other essays, maintainer of the ,Jargon File, (which was previously maintained by ,Guy L. Steele, Jr.,).
,Within the computer programmer subculture of hackers, the term hacker is also used for a programmer who reaches a goal by employing a series of modifications to extend existing ,code, or resources. In this sense, it can have a negative connotation of using inelegant ,kludges, to accomplish programming tasks that are quick, but ugly, inelegant, difficult to extend, hard to maintain and inefficient. This derogatory form of the noun "",hack,"" derives from the everyday English sense ""to cut or shape by or as if by crude or ruthless strokes"" [Merriam-Webster] and is even used among users of the positive sense of ""hacker"" who produces ""cool"" or ""neat"" hacks. In other words, to ""hack"" at an original creation, as if with an axe, is to force-fit it into being usable for a task not intended by the original creator, and a ""hacker"" would be someone who does this habitually. (The original creator and the hacker may be the same person.) This usage is common in both programming, engineering and building. In programming, hacking in this sense appears to be tolerated and seen as a necessary compromise in many situations. Some argue that it should not be, due to this negative meaning; others argue that some kludges can, for all their ugliness and imperfection, still have ""hack value"".
,In non-software engineering, the culture is less tolerant of unmaintainable solutions, even when intended to be temporary, and describing someone as a ""hacker"" might imply that they lack professionalism. In this sense, the term has no real positive connotations, except for the idea that the hacker is capable of doing modifications that allow a system to work in the short term, and so has some sort of marketable skills. However, there is always the understanding that a more skillful or technical logician could have produced successful modifications that would not be considered a ""hack-job"". The definition is similar to other, non-computer based uses of the term ""hack-job"". For instance, a professional modification of a production sports car into a racing machine would not be considered a hack-job, but a cobbled together backyard mechanic's result could be. Even though the outcome of a race of the two machines could not be assumed, a quick inspection would instantly reveal the difference in the level of professionalism of the designers. The adjective associated with hacker is ""hackish"" (see the ,Jargon file,).
,In a very universal sense, hacker also means someone who makes things work beyond perceived limits in a clever way in general, without necessarily referring to computers, especially at MIT.,[25], That is, people who apply the creative attitude of software hackers in fields other than computing. This includes even activities that predate computer hacking, for example ,reality hackers, or ,urban spelunkers, (exploring undocumented or unauthorized areas in buildings). One specific example is clever pranks,[26], traditionally perpetrated by MIT students, with the perpetrator being called hacker. For example, when MIT students surreptitiously put a fake police car atop the dome on MIT's Building 10,,[27], that was a hack in this sense, and the students involved were therefore hackers. Other types of hacking are ,reality hackers,, ,wetware, hackers (""hack your brain""), and ,media hackers, (""hack your reputation""). In a similar vein, a ""hack"" may refer to a ,math, hack, that is, a clever solution to a mathematical problem. All of these uses have spread beyond MIT.
,
,Home computing enthusiasts,
,Main article: ,Hacking of consumer electronics,
,In yet another context, a hacker is a computer hobbyist who pushes the limits of software or hardware. The home computer hacking subculture relates to the hobbyist home computing of the late 1970s, beginning with the availability of ,MITS Altair,. An influential organization was the ,Homebrew Computer Club,. However, its roots go back further to ,amateur radio, enthusiasts. The amateur radio slang referred to creatively tinkering to improve performance as ""hacking"" already in the 1950s.,[28],
,A large overlaps between hobbyist hackers and the programmer subculture hackers existed during the Homebrew Club's days, but the interests and values of both communities somewhat diverged. Today, the hobbyists focus on commercial ,computer and video games,, ,software cracking, and exceptional computer programming (,demo scene,). Also of interest to some members of this group is the modification of computer hardware and other electronic devices, see ,modding,.
,
,  ,A ,DIY, musician probes the circuit board of a synthesizer for ,""bends"", using a jeweler's screwdriver and alligator clips,
,Electronics hobbyists working on machines other than computers also fall into this category. This includes people who do simple modifications to ,graphing calculators,, ,video game consoles,, electronic ,musical keyboards, or other device (see ,CueCat, for a notorious example) to expose or add functionality to a device that was unintended for use by end users by the company who created it. A number of ,techno, musicians have modified 1980s-era ,Casio SK-1, sampling keyboards to create unusual sounds by doing ,circuit bending,: connecting wires to different leads of the integrated circuit chips. The results of these DIY experiments range from opening up previously inaccessible features that were part of the chip design to producing the strange, dis-harmonic digital tones that became part of the techno music style.
Companies take different attitudes towards such practices, ranging from open acceptance (such as ,Texas Instruments, for its graphing calculators and ,Lego, for its ,Lego Mindstorms, robotics gear) to outright hostility (such as ,Microsoft,'s attempts to lock out ,Xbox, hackers or the ,DRM, routines on ,Blu-ray Disc, players designed to sabotage compromised players.,[,citation needed,],)
,In this context, a ""hack"" refers to a ,program, that (sometimes illegally) modifies another program, often a video game, giving the user access to features otherwise inaccessible to them. As an example of this use, for ,Palm OS, users (until the 4th iteration of this ,operating system,), a ""hack"" refers to an extension of the operating system which provides additional functionality. Term also refers to those people who cheat on video games using special software. This can also refer to the ,jailbreaking, of ,iPhones,.
,
,Hacker artists,
,See also: ,Fractal art,, ,algorithmic art,, and ,interactive art,
,Hacker artists create ,art, by hacking on ,technology, as an ,artistic medium,. This has extended the definition of the term and what it means to be a hacker. Such ,artists, may work with ,graphics,, ,computer hardware,, ,sculpture,, ,music, and other ,audio,, ,animation,, ,video,, ,software,, ,simulations,, ,mathematics,, reactive ,sensory, systems, text, ,poetry,, ,literature,, or any combination thereof.
,Dartmouth College, musician Larry Polansky states:
,
,Technology and art are inextricably related. Many musicians, video artists, graphic artists, and even poets who work with technology—whether designing it or using it—consider themselves to be part of the 'hacker community.' Computer artists, like non-art hackers, often find themselves on society’s fringes, developing strange, innovative uses of existing technology. There is an empathetic relationship between those, for example, who design experimental music software and hackers who write communications ,freeware,.,[29],
,
,Another description is offered by Jenny Marketou: 
,
,Hacker artists operate as ,culture, hackers who manipulate existing techno-,semiotic, structures towards a different end, to get inside cultural systems on the net and make them do things they were never intended to do.,[30],
,
,A successful software and hardware hacker artist is ,Mark Lottor, (mkl), who has created the 3-D light art projects entitled the ,Cubatron,, and the ,Big Round Cubatron,. This art is made using custom computer technology, with specially designed ,circuit boards, and programming for ,microprocessor, chips to manipulate the ,LED, lights.
,
,Don Hopkins, is a software hacker artist well known for his artistic cellular automata. This art, created by a ,cellular automata, computer program, generates objects which randomly bump into each other and in turn create more objects and designs, similar to a lava lamp, except that the parts change color and form through interaction. Hopkins Says: ,Cellular automata are simple rules that are applied to a grid of cells, or the pixel values of an image. The same rule is applied to every cell, to determine its next state, based on the previous state of that cell and its neighboring cells. There are many interesting cellular automata rules, and they all look very different, with amazing animated dynamic effects. ',Life,' is a widely known cellular automata rule, but many other lesser known rules are much more interesting.
,
,Some hacker artists create art by writing computer code, and others, by developing hardware. Some create with existing software tools such as ,Adobe Photoshop, or ,GIMP,.
,The creative process of hacker artists can be more abstract than artists using non-technological media. For example, ,mathematicians, have produced visually stunning graphic presentations of ,fractals,, which hackers have further enhanced, often producing detailed and intricate graphics and animations from simple mathematical formulas.

,History,[,edit,],
,CNRI formerly operated the Secretariat of the ,Internet Engineering Task Force,.,[4], ,Guido van Rossum,, pioneer for open source software and creator of Python, at one time worked for this company. The formation and early funding of the ,Internet Society, were led by CNRI. At the first meeting of the Internet Society board, Vint Cerf, representing CNRI, offered, ""In the event a deficit occurs, CNRI has agreed to contribute up to USD102000 to offset it."",[5], In the event, the contribution was not needed. CNRI did cover many of the expenses of the Internet Society in 1992. They also paid Cerf's salary during 1993, when much of his time was devoted to building the Internet Society.,[6],
,
,Handle System,[,edit,],
,In 1996, the ,Association of American Publishers, announced that ,R.R. Bowker, and the CNRI had been selected to design a ,Digital Object Identifier, system. The effort was initiated after a year-long study of the need for a system to identify electronic copyright ownership and to manage the digital purchase of rights.,[7],  The CNRI Handle system was first demonstrated at a February 1997 meeting of the Professional/Scholarly Publishing (PSP) division of the AAP meeting in Washington, DC.,[8], The ,Handle System, is a technology specification for assigning, managing, and resolving ,persistent identifiers, for digital objects and other resources on the Internet. The DONA System is under consideration at the ,ITU,[9], and has been adopted by several countries.,[10],
,
,D-Lib,[,edit,],
,D-Lib Magazine, was an on-line magazine dedicated to digital library research and development, produced by CNRI.
,
,Software,[,edit,],
,DO Repository and DO Registry,[,edit,],
,CNRI developed the Digital Object (DO) Repository software, with digital object architecture which provides a mechanism for the creation of, and access to, digital objects as discrete data structures with unique, resolvable identifiers.,[11],

,Plain text vs. rich text,[,edit,],
,Main articles: ,Plain text, and ,Rich text,
,There are important differences between plain text (created and edited by text editors) and ,rich text, (such as that created by ,word processors, or ,desktop publishing software,). 
,Plain text exclusively consists of character representation. Each character is represented by a fixed-length sequence of one, two, or four bytes, or as a variable-length sequence of one to four bytes, in accordance to specific ,character encoding, conventions, such as ,ASCII,, ,ISO/IEC 2022,,  ,UTF-8,, or ,Unicode,. These conventions define many printable characters, but also ,non-printing characters, that control the flow of the text, such ,space,, ,line break,, and ,page break,. Plain text contains no other information about the text itself, not even the character encoding convention employed. Plain text is stored in ,text files,, although text files do not exclusively store plain text. In the early days of computers, plain text was displayed using a ,monospace font,, such that horizontal alignment and columnar formatting were sometimes done using whitespace characters. For compatibility reasons, this tradition has not changed.
,Rich text, on the other hand, may contain metadata, character formatting data (e.g. ,typeface, size, weight and style,), paragraph formatting data (e.g. indentation, alignment, letter and word distribution, and space between lines or other paragraphs), and page specification data (e.g. size, margin and reading direction). Rich text can be very complex. Rich text can be saved in ,binary format, (e.g. ,DOC,), text files adhering to a ,markup language, (e.g. ,RTF, or ,HTML,), or in a hybrid form of both (e.g. ,Office Open XML,).
,Text editors are intended to open and save text files containing either plain text or anything that can be interpreted as plain text, including the markup for rich text or the markup for something else (e.g. ,SVG,).
,
,History,[,edit,],
,  ,A box of ,punched cards, with several program decks.,
,Before text editors existed, computer text was punched into ,cards, with ,keypunch, machines. Physical boxes of these thin cardboard cards were then inserted into a card-reader. Magnetic tape and disk ""card-image"" files created from such card decks often had no line-separation characters at all, and assumed fixed-length 80-character records. An alternative to cards was punched paper tape. It could be created by some ,teleprinters, (such as the ,Teletype,), which used special characters to indicate ends of records.
,The first text editors were ,""line editors"", oriented to teleprinter- or ,typewriter,-style terminals without displays. Commands (often a single keystroke) effected edits to a file at an imaginary insertion point called the ""cursor"". Edits were verified by typing a command to print a small section of the file, and periodically by printing the entire file. In some line editors, the cursor could be moved by commands that specified the line number in the file, text ,strings, (context) for which to search, and eventually ,regular expressions,. Line editors were major improvements over keypunching. Some line editors could be used by keypunch; editing commands could be taken from a deck of cards and applied to a specified file. Some common line editors supported a ""verify"" mode in which change commands displayed the altered lines.
,When ,computer terminals, with video screens became available, ,screen-based text editors, (sometimes called just ""screen editors"") became common. One of the earliest full-screen editors was ,O26,, which was written for the operator console of the ,CDC 6000 series, computers in 1967. Another early full-screen editor was ,vi,. Written in the 1970s, it is still a standard editor,[5], on ,Unix, and ,Linux, operating systems.  Also written in the 1970s was the ,UCSD Pascal, Screen Oriented Editor, which was optimized both for indented source code as well as general text.,[6], ,Emacs,, one of the first ,free and open source software, projects, is another early full-screen or real-time editor, one that was ,ported, to many systems.,[7], A full-screen editor's ease-of-use and speed (compared to the line-based editors) motivated many early purchases of video terminals.,[8],
,The core data structure in a text editor is the one that manages the string (sequence of characters) or list of ,records, that represents the current state of the file being edited.
While the former could be stored in a single long consecutive ,array, of characters,
the desire for text editors that could more quickly insert text, delete text, and undo/redo previous edits led to the development of more complicated sequence data structures.,[9],
A typical text editor uses a ,gap buffer,, a ,linked list, of lines (as in ,PaperClip,), a ,piece table,, or a ,rope,, as its sequence data structure.
,
,Types of text editors,[,edit,],
,  ,Emacs, a text editor popular among programmers, running on ,Microsoft Windows,
,Some text editors are small and simple, while others offer broad and complex functions. For example, ,Unix, and Unix-like operating systems have the ,pico, editor (or a variant), but many also include the ,vi, and Emacs editors. ,Microsoft Windows, systems come with the simple ,Notepad,, though many people—especially programmers—prefer other ,editors, with more features. Under ,Apple Macintosh,'s ,classic Mac OS, there was the native ,SimpleText,, which was replaced in ,Mac OS X, by ,TextEdit,, which combines features of a text editor with those typical of a word processor such as rulers, margins and multiple font selection. These features are not available simultaneously, but must be switched by user command, or through the program automatically determining the ,file type,. 
,Most word processors can read and write files in plain text format, allowing them to open files saved from text editors. Saving these files from a word processor, however, requires ensuring the file is written in ,plain text, format, and that any ,text encoding, or ,BOM, settings won't obscure the file for its intended use. Non-,WYSIWYG, word processors, such as ,WordStar,, are more easily pressed into service as text editors, and in fact were commonly used as such during the 1980s. The default ,file format, of these word processors often resembles a markup language, with the basic format being plain text and visual formatting achieved using non-printing ,control characters, or ,escape sequences,. Later word processors like ,Microsoft Word, store their files in a ,binary format, and are almost never used to edit plain text files.,[10],
,Some text editors can ,edit unusually large files, such as ,log files, or an entire ,database, placed in a single file. Simpler text editors may just read files into the computer's main ,memory,. With larger files, this may be a slow process, and the entire file may not fit.  Some text editors do not let the user start editing until this read-in is complete. Editing performance also often suffers in nonspecialized editors, with the editor taking seconds or even minutes to respond to keystrokes or navigation commands. By only storing the visible portion of large files in memory, editing performance improves.
,Some editors are programmable, meaning, e.g., they can be customized for specific uses. With a programmable editor it is easy to automate repetitive tasks or, add new functionality or even implement a new application within the framework of the editor.  One common motive for customizing is to make a text editor use the commands of another text editor with which the user is more familiar, or to duplicate missing functionality the user has come to depend on. Software developers often use editor customizations tailored to the programming language or development environment they are working in. The programmability of some text editors is limited to enhancing the core editing functionality of the program, but ,Emacs, can be extended far beyond editing text files—for web browsing, reading email, online chat, managing files or playing games. Emacs can even emulate ,Vi,, its rival in the traditional ,editor wars, of ,Unix culture,.,[11],[12],
,An important group of programmable editors uses ,REXX,[a], as a scripting language. These ""orthodox editors"" contain a ""command line"" into which commands and macros can be typed and text lines into which line commands,[b], and macros can be typed. Most such editors are derivatives of ,ISPF/PDF, ,EDIT, or of ,XEDIT,, IBM's flagship editor for ,VM/SP, through ,z/VM,. Among them are ,THE,, ,KEDIT,, X2, Uni-edit, and ,SEDIT,.
,A text editor written or customized for a specific use can determine what the user is editing and assist the user, often by ,completing, programming terms and showing ,tooltips, with relevant documentation.  Many text editors for software developers include source code ,syntax highlighting, and automatic ,indentation, to make programs easier to read and write.  Programming editors often let the user select the name of an ,include file,, ,function, or ,variable,, then jump to its definition. Some also allow for easy navigation back to the original section of code by storing the initial cursor location or by displaying the requested definition in a ,popup window, or temporary buffer. Some editors implement this ability themselves, but often an auxiliary utility like ,ctags, is used to locate the definitions.
,
,Typical features,[,edit,],
,Find and replace, – Text editors provide extensive facilities for searching and replacing text, either on groups of files or interactively. Advanced editors can use ,regular expressions, to search and edit text or code.,
,Cut, copy, and paste, – most text editors provide methods to duplicate and move text within the file, or between files.,
,Ability to handle ,UTF-8, encoded text.,
,Text formatting, – Text editors often provide basic formatting features like ,line wrap,, ,auto-indentation,, ,bullet list, formatting using ,ASCII, characters, ,comment formatting,, ,syntax highlighting, and so on.,
,Undo and redo, – As with word processors, text editors provide a way to undo and redo the last edit, or more.  Often—especially with older text editors—there is only one level of edit history remembered and successively issuing the undo command will only ""toggle"" the last change.  Modern or more complex editors usually provide a multiple-level history such that issuing the undo command repeatedly will revert the document to successively older edits.  A separate redo command will cycle the edits ""forward"" toward the most recent changes.  The number of changes remembered depends upon the editor and is often configurable by the user.,
,Advanced features,[,edit,],
,Macro or procedure definition: to define new commands or features as combinations of prior commands or other macros, perhaps with passed parameters, or with nesting of macros.,
,Multi-file editing: the ability to edit multiple files during an edit-session, perhaps remembering the current-line cursor of each file, to insert repeated text into each file, move text among files, etc.,
,Data transformation, – Reading or merging the contents of another text file into the file currently being edited.  Some text editors provide a way to insert the output of a command issued to the operating system's ,shell,. Also, a case-shifting feature could translate to lowercase or uppercase.,
,Filtering, – Some advanced text editors allow the editor to send all or sections of the file being edited to another utility and read the result back into the file in place of the lines being ""filtered"".  This, for example, is useful for sorting a series of lines alphabetically or numerically, doing mathematical computations, indenting ,source code,, and so on.,
,Syntax highlighting, – contextually highlights ,source code,, ,markup languages,, ,config files, and other text that appears in an organized or predictable format. Editors generally allow users to customize the colors or styles used for each language element. Some text editors also allow users to install and use ,themes, to change the ,look and feel, of the editor's entire ,user interface,.,
,Extensibility, - a text editor intended for use by programmers must provide some ,plugin, mechanism, or be ,scriptable,, so a programmer can customize the editor with features needed to manage individual software projects, customize functionality or ,key bindings, for specific ,programming languages, or ,version control, systems, or conform to specific ,coding styles,.,
,Specialised editors,[,edit,],
,Some editors include special features and extra functions, for instance,
,
,Source code editors, are text editors with additional functionality to facilitate the production of source code.  These often feature user-programmable syntax highlighting and code navigation functions as well as coding tools or keyboard ,macros, similar to an HTML editor (see below).,
,Folding editors,. This subclass includes so-called ""orthodox editors"" that are derivatives of Xedit. Editors that implement folding without programing-specific features are usually called outliners (see below).,
,IDEs, (integrated development environments) are designed to manage and streamline large programming projects.  They are usually only used for programming as they contain many features unnecessary for simple text editing.,
,World Wide Web, authors are offered a variety of ,HTML editors, dedicated to the task of creating ,web pages,. These include: ,Dreamweaver,, ,KompoZer, and ,E Text Editor,.  Many offer the option of viewing a work in progress on a built-in ,HTML rendering engine, or standard ,web browser,. Most ,web development, is done in a ,dynamic programming language, such as ,Ruby, or ,PHP, using a source code editor or IDE. The HTML delivered by all but the simplest static web sites is stored as individual ,template files, that are assembled by the software controlling the site and do not compose a complete HTML document.,
,Mathematicians, physicists, and computer scientists often produce articles and books using ,TeX, or ,LaTeX, in plain text files. Such documents are often produced by a standard text editor, but some people use specialized ,TeX editors,.,
,Outliners,. Also called tree-based editors, because they combine a hierarchical outline tree with a text editor. Folding (see above) can be considered a specialized form of outlining.,
,Collaborative editors, allow multiple users to work on the same document simultaneously from remote locations over a network. The changes made by individual users are tracked and merged into the document automatically to eliminate the possibility of conflicting edits. These editors also typically include an ,online chat, component for discussion among editors.,
,Simultaneous editing, is a technique in ,End-user development, research to edit all items in a multiple selection. It allows the user to manipulate all the selected items at once through ,direct manipulation,. The ,Lapis text editor,[13],[14], and the ,multi edit,[15], plugin for ,gedit, are examples of this technique. The Lapis editor can also create an automatic multiple selection based on an example item.,
,Distraction-free editors, provide a ,minimalistic, interface with the purpose of isolating the writer from the rest of the applications and operating system, thus being able to focus on the writing without distractions from interface elements like a ,toolbar, or ,notification area,.,
,Programmable editors can usually be enhanced to perform any or all of these functions, but simpler editors focus on just one, or, like ,gPHPedit,, are targeted at a single programming language.

,^, ,Originally macros were written in assembler, ,CLIST, (,TSO,), ,CMS EXEC, (,VM,), ,EXEC2, (VM/SE) or ,PL/I,, but most users dropped CLIST, EXEC and EXEC2 once REXX was available.,
,
,^, ,A line command is a command typed into the sequence number entry area associated with a specific line of text and whose scope is limited to that line, or, in the case of a block command, associated with the block of lines between the beginning and ending line commands. An example of the latter would be typing the command ,ucc, (block upper case) into the entry areas of two lines; this has the same effect as typing ,uc, (upper case) into the entry area of each line in the range.,

,For the political term, see ,Benevolent dictatorship,.,
,Benevolent dictator for life, (,BDFL,) is a title given to a small number of ,open-source software development, leaders, typically project founders who retain the final say in disputes or arguments within the community. The phrase originated in 1995 with reference to ,Guido van Rossum,, creator of the ,Python programming language,,,[1],[2], while in 2018, Van Rossum stepped down as the leader in the language community after 30 years.
,Shortly after Van Rossum joined the ,Corporation for National Research Initiatives,, the term appeared in a follow-up mail by ,Ken Manheimer, to a meeting trying to create a semi-formal group that would oversee Python development and workshops; this initial use included the additional joke of naming Van Rossum the ""First Interim BDFL"".,[1], Van Rossum announced on July 12, 2018, that he would be stepping down from BDFL of Python.,[3],
,BDFL should not be confused with the more common term for open-source leaders, "",benevolent dictator,"", which was popularized by ,Eric S. Raymond,'s essay "",Homesteading the Noosphere,"" (1999).,[4], Among other topics related to ,hacker culture,, Raymond elaborates on how the nature of open source forces the ""dictatorship"" to keep itself benevolent, since a strong disagreement can lead to the ,forking, of the project under the rule of new leaders.

" 5 November 2018, at 20:21","  ,A timeline chart of how ,Linux distributions, have forked.,
,In ,software engineering,, a ,project fork, happens when developers take a copy of ,source code, from one ,software package, and start independent development on it, creating a distinct and separate piece of software. The term often implies not merely a ,development branch,, but also a split in the developer community, a form of ,schism,.,[1],
,Free and open-source software, is that which, by definition, may be forked from the original development team without prior permission, without violating ,copyright, law. However, licensed forks of proprietary software (,e.g., ,Unix,) also happen.

,Etymology,[,edit,],
,The word ""fork"" has been used to mean ""to divide in branches, go separate ways"" as early as the 14th century.,[2], In the software environment, the word evokes the ,fork, system call, which causes a running process to split itself into two (almost) identical copies that (typically) diverge to perform different tasks.,[3],
,In the context of software development, ""fork"" was used in the sense of creating a revision control "",branch,"" by ,Eric Allman, as early as 1980, in the context of ,SCCS,:,[4],

,The term was in use on ,Usenet, by 1983 for the process of creating a subgroup to move topics of discussion to.,[5],
,""Fork"" is not known to have been used in the sense of a community schism during the origins of Lucid Emacs (now ,XEmacs,) (1991) or the ,BSDs, (1993–1994); ,Russ Nelson, used the term ""shattering"" for this sort of fork in 1993, attributing it to ,John Gilmore,.,[6], However, ""fork"" was in use in the present sense by 1995 to describe the XEmacs split,,[7], and was an understood usage in the ,GNU, Project by 1996.,[8],
,
,Forking of free and open-source software,[,edit,],
,Free and open-source software may be legally forked without prior approval of those currently developing, managing, or distributing the software per both ,The Free Software Definition, and ,The Open Source Definition,:,[9],
,
,The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this, you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.,— ,The Free Software Definition,[10],
,
,3. Derived Works: The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.,— ,The Open Source Definition,[11],
,
,In free software, forks often result from a schism over different goals or personality clashes. In a fork, both parties assume nearly identical code bases, but typically only the larger group, or whoever controls the Web site, will retain the full original name and the associated user community. Thus, there is a reputation penalty associated with forking.,[9], The relationship between the different teams can be cordial or very bitter.
,Eric S. Raymond,, in his essay ,Homesteading the Noosphere,,,[12], stated that ""The most important characteristic of a fork is that it spawns competing projects that cannot later exchange code, splitting the potential developer community"". He notes in the ,Jargon File,:,[13],
,
,Forking is considered a Bad Thing—not merely because it implies a lot of wasted effort in the future, but because forks tend to be accompanied by a great deal of strife and acrimony between the successor groups over issues of legitimacy, succession, and design direction. There is serious social pressure against forking. As a result, major forks (such as the ,Gnu-Emacs,/,XEmacs, split, the fissioning of the ,386BSD, group into three daughter projects, and the short-lived GCC/EGCS split) are rare enough that they are remembered individually in hacker folklore.
,
,David A. Wheeler, notes,[9], four possible outcomes of a fork, with examples:
,
,The death of the fork. This is by far the most common case. It is easy to declare a fork, but considerable effort to continue independent development and support.,
,A re-merging of the fork (,e.g.,, ,egcs, becoming ""blessed"" as the new version of ,gcc,.),
,The death of the original (,e.g., the ,X.Org Server, succeeding and ,XFree86, dying.),
,Successful branching, typically with differentiation (,e.g.,, ,OpenBSD, and ,NetBSD,.),
,Distributed revision control, (DVCS) tools have popularised a less emotive use of the term ""fork"", blurring the distinction with ""branch"".,[14], With a DVCS such as ,Mercurial, or ,Git,, the normal way to contribute to a project, is to first create a personal branch of the repository, independent of the main repository, and later seek to have your changes integrated with it. Sites such as ,GitHub,, ,Bitbucket, and ,Launchpad, provide free DVCS hosting expressly supporting independent branches, such that the technical, social and financial barriers to forking a source code repository are massively reduced, and GitHub uses ""fork"" as its term for this method of contribution to a project.
,Forks often restart version numbering from 0.1 or 1.0 even if the original software was at version 3.0, 4.0, or 5.0. An exception is when the forked software is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the original project, ,e.g., ,MariaDB, for ,MySQL,[15], or ,LibreOffice, for ,OpenOffice.org,.
,
,Forking proprietary software,[,edit,],
,In ,proprietary software,, the copyright is usually held by the employing entity, not by the individual software developers. Proprietary code is thus more commonly forked when the owner needs to develop two or more versions, such as a ,windowed, version and a ,command line, version, or versions for differing operating systems, such as a ,word processor, for ,IBM PC, compatible machines and ,Macintosh, computers. Generally, such internal forks will concentrate on having the same look, feel, data format, and behavior between platforms so that a user familiar with one can also be productive or share documents generated on the other. This is almost always an economic decision to generate a greater ,market share, and thus pay back the associated extra development costs created by the fork.
,A notable proprietary fork not of this kind is the many varieties of proprietary ,Unix,—almost all derived from AT&T Unix under license and all called ""Unix"", but increasingly mutually incompatible.,[16], ,See, ,UNIX wars,.
,The ,BSD licenses, permit forks to become proprietary software, and some say,[,who?,], that commercial incentives thus make proprietisation almost inevitable. Examples include ,macOS, (based on the proprietary ,NeXTSTEP, and the open source ,FreeBSD,), ,Cedega, and ,CrossOver, (proprietary forks of ,Wine,, though CrossOver tracks Wine and contributes considerably), EnterpriseDB (a fork of ,PostgreSQL,, adding Oracle compatibility features,[17],), Supported PostgreSQL with their proprietary ESM storage system,,[18], and Netezza's,[19], proprietary highly scalable derivative of PostgreSQL. Some of these vendors contribute back changes to the community project, while some keep their changes as their own competitive advantages.

,InterPlanetary File System, (,IPFS,) is a ,protocol, and network designed to create a ,content-addressable,, ,peer-to-peer, method of storing and sharing ,hypermedia, in a ,distributed file system,.,[2], IPFS was initially designed by ,Juan Benet,, and is now an ,open-source, project developed with help from the community.,[3],[4],

,History,[,edit,],
,In 2014, the IPFS protocol took advantage of the ,Bitcoin, ,blockchain, ,protocol, and network infrastructure in order to store unalterable data, remove duplicated files across the network, and obtain address information for accessing storage nodes to search for files in the network.,[5],[2],
,Implementations in ,Go,[6], and ,JavaScript,[7], exist, and a ,Python, implementation is in progress.,[8], The Go implementation is considered to be the ,reference implementation,[9], while formal ,specifications, are developed.,[10],
,
,Overview,[,edit,],
,IPFS is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. In some ways, IPFS is similar to the ,World Wide Web,, but IPFS could be seen as a single ,BitTorrent, swarm, exchanging objects within one ,Git, repository. In other words, IPFS provides a high-throughput, content-addressed ,block storage, model, with content-addressed ,hyperlinks,.,[11], This forms a generalized ,Merkle, ,directed acyclic graph, (DAG). IPFS combines a ,distributed hash table,, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace. IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other not to tamper with data in transit.,[12], Distributed Content Delivery saves bandwidth and prevents ,DDoS attacks,, which HTTP struggles with.,[5],
,The filesystem can be accessed in a variety of ways, including via ,FUSE, and over ,HTTP,.,[11],  A local file can be added to the IPFS filesystem, making it available to the world. Files are identified by their hashes, so it's caching-friendly. They are distributed using a BitTorrent-based protocol.  Other users viewing the content aid in serving the content to others on the network.  IPFS has a name service called IPNS, a global namespace based on ,PKI,, serves to build trust chains, is compatible with other NSes and can map ,DNS,, .onion, .bit, etc. to IPNS.,[13],
,
,  ,The Wikipedia logo has an IPFS hash with the following code: QmRW3V9znzFW9M5FYbitSEvd5dQrPWGvPvgQD6LM22Tv8D. It can be accessed with that hash over HTTP by a ,public gateway, or a ,local IPFS instance,
,Merkle data format,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Merkle tree,
,Every ,Merkle, is a ,directed acyclic graph, (DAG) because each node is accessed via its name. Each branch of Merkle is the hash of its local contents, naming children by their hash instead of their full contents. So after creation there is no way to edit a node. This prevents cycles (assuming there are no ,hash collisions,), since one cannot link the first created node to the last node to create the last reference.
,In general, for any Merkle to create a new branch or verify an existing branch, a hash algorithm is used on some combination of the local contents, such as a list of child hashes and other bytes. A few different hash algorithms are available in IPFS.
,The data input to any of those hash algorithms is documented.,[14],
,
,Notable users,[,edit,],
,The ,Catalan independence referendum,, taking place in September–October 2017, was deemed illegal by the ,Constitutional Court of Spain, and many related websites were blocked. Subsequently, the Catalan Pirate Party mirrored the website on IPFS to bypass the ,High Court of Justice of Catalonia, order of blocking.,[15],[16],
,IPFS was used to create a mirror of Wikipedia, which allows people living in jurisdictions where Wikipedia is blocked to access the content of Wikipedia.,[17],  That archived version of Wikipedia is a limited immutable copy that cannot be updated.  Efforts are being made to resolve mutable (updatable) and immutable (permanent archive) systems and interfaces.,[,citation needed,],
,Filecoin,, also inter-related to IPFS and developed by ,Juan Benet, and ,Protocol Labs,, is an IPFS-based ,cooperative storage cloud,.,[18],

,Dries Buytaert, (born 19 November 1978 in ,Wilrijk,, ,Antwerp,, ,Belgium,),[1], is an ,open-source software, ,programmer, notable as founder and lead developer of the ,Drupal, content management system.,[2],[3],[4],

,Career,[,edit,],
,Buytaert defended his PhD dissertation in ,Computer Science, on 27 January 2008,[5], at ,Ghent University, in Belgium.,[6],
,From 1999-2000 he was the maintainer of the ,Linux,-,WLAN, FAQ,.,[7],
,On 1 December 2007, Dries,[8], announced, together with co-founder ,Jay Batson, the launch of a start-up called ,Acquia,.,[9], Acquia is a commercial open-source software company providing products, services, and technical support for Drupal. Acquia wants to be to Drupal what ,Red Hat, has been to ,Linux,.,[10], In 2009, Acquia helped re-launch Whitehouse.gov on Drupal.,[11],
,On 31 March 2008, Dries launched ,Mollom,, a service dedicated to stopping website spam: ""Mollom's purpose is to dramatically reduce the effort of keeping your site clean and the quality of your content high. Currently, Mollom is a spam-killing one-two punch combination of a state-of-the-art spam filter and CAPTCHA server."" Over 59,000 websites are protected by the Mollom service,,[12], including all of ,Netlog,'s messages.,[13],
,In 2008, Buytaert was elected ""Young Entrepreneurs of Tech"" by ,BusinessWeek,.,[14], He was also named to the ,MIT, ,Technology Review, ,TR35, as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.,[15],[16],
,
,Dismissal of Larry Garfield,[,edit,],
,In March of 2017, Buytaert fired veteran Drupal developer Larry Garfield and disinvited him from DrupalCon, shortly after forum posts came to light that outed Garfield as a participant in the ,Gorean subculture,. In a March 22 blog post, Garfield accused Buytaert of tolerating ,doxing, and wrote that Drupal's Community Working Group had not found any Code of Conduct violations in his history.,[17], Buytaert made a post the next day which defended the firing as necessary for fostering an inclusive community. He also wrote that his precise reasoning was confidential and that he ""did not make the decision based on the information or beliefs conveyed in Larry's blog post."",[17], Several commentators disputed this characterization citing Buytaert's criticism of Gorean gender roles in the same post and the deleted sentence ""further participation in a leadership role implies our community is complicit with and/or endorses these views, which we do not."",[18], Garfield also stated that he was ignorant of other ""things not mentioned"" that could have led to his dismissal.,[19], 85 Drupal developers posted an open letter criticizing Buytaert for his handling of the situation with ,Jon Evans, describing it as a form of ,victim blaming,.,[17],[20],

" 19 November 2018, at 16:13",""",Homesteading the Noosphere,"" (abbreviated ,HtN,) is an ,essay, written by ,Eric S. Raymond, about the social workings of ,open-source, ,software development,. It follows his previous piece "",The Cathedral and the Bazaar,"" (1997).
,The essay examines issues of ,project, ownership and transfer, as well as investigating possible ,anthropological, roots of the ,gift culture, in open source as contrasted with the exchange culture of ,closed source, software. Raymond also investigates the nature of the spread of open source into the untamed frontier of ideas he terms the ,noosphere,, postulating that projects that range too far ahead of their time fail because they are too far out in the wilderness, and that successful projects tend to relate to existing projects.
,Raymond delves into the contrast between the stated aims of open source and observed behaviors, and also explores the underlying motivations of people involved in the ,open source movement,. He seems to settle on the idea that open-source practitioners find striving for a great ,reputation, within the ""tribe"" a key motivational feature.

,Drupal, ,/,ˈ,d,r,uː,p,əl,/, is ,[5], a ,free, and ,open source, ,content-management framework, written in ,PHP, and distributed under the ,GNU General Public License,.,[4],[6],[7], Drupal provides a ,back-end, framework for at least 2.3% of all ,web sites, worldwide,[8],[9], – ranging from personal ,blogs, to corporate, political, and government sites.,[10], Systems also use Drupal for ,knowledge management, and for business collaboration.,[11],
,As of  September 2018,[update],, the Drupal community comprised more than 1.3 million members,,[12],[13], including 112,500 users actively contributing,,[14], resulting in more than 41,500 free modules that extend and customize Drupal functionality,,[15], over 2,670 free themes that change the look and feel of Drupal,,[16], and at least 1,240 free distributions that allow users to quickly and easily set up a complex, use-specific Drupal in fewer steps.,[17],
,The standard release of Drupal, known as ,Drupal core,, contains basic features common to ,content-management systems,. These include user account registration and maintenance, menu management, ,RSS, feeds, taxonomy, page layout customization, and system administration. The Drupal core installation can serve as a simple Web site, a single- or multi-user blog, an ,Internet forum,, or a community Web site providing for ,user-generated content,.
,Drupal also describes itself as a ,Web application framework,.,[18], When compared with notable frameworks Drupal meets most of the generally accepted ,feature requirements, for such web frameworks.,[19],[20],[21],
,Although Drupal offers a sophisticated ,API, for developers, basic Web-site installation and administration of the framework require no programming skills.,[22],
,Drupal runs on any ,computing platform, that supports both a ,Web server, capable of running PHP and a ,database, to store content and configuration.

,  ,Drupal version 1-6 release history timeline,
,Originally written by ,Dries Buytaert, as a ,message board,, Drupal became an ,open source, project in 2001.,[26], The name ,Drupal, represents an English rendering of the ,Dutch, word ,druppel,, which means ""drop"" (as in a water droplet).,[27], The name came from the now-defunct Drop.org Web site, whose code slowly evolved into Drupal. Buytaert wanted to call the site ""dorp"" (Dutch for ""village"") for its community aspects, but mistyped it when checking the domain name and thought the error sounded better.,[26],
,Interest in Drupal got a significant boost in 2003 when it helped build ""DeanSpace"" for ,Howard Dean,, one of the candidates in the ,U.S. Democratic Party,'s primary campaign for the ,2004 U.S. presidential election,.  DeanSpace used open-source sharing of Drupal to support a decentralized network of approximately 50 disparate, unofficial pro-Dean websites that allowed users to communicate directly with one another as well as with the campaign.,[28], After Dean ended his campaign, members of his Web team continued to pursue their interest in developing a Web platform that could aid political activism by launching CivicSpace Labs in July 2004, ""...the first company with full-time employees that was developing and distributing Drupal technology."",[29], Other companies began to also specialize in Drupal development.,[30],[31], By 2013 the Drupal Web site listed hundreds of vendors that offered Drupal-related services.,[32],
,As of  2014,[update], Drupal is developed by a community,,[33], and its popularity is growing rapidly.,[,citation needed,], From July 2007 to June 2008 the Drupal.org site provided more than 1.4 million downloads of Drupal software, an increase of approximately 125% from the previous year.,[34],[35],
,As of  January 2017,[update], more than 1,180,000 sites use Drupal.,[36], These include hundreds of well-known organizations,,[37], including corporations, media and publishing companies, governments, non-profits,,[38], schools, and individuals.  Drupal has won several ,Packt, Open Source CMS Awards,[39], and won the ,Webware 100,[,clarification needed,], three times in a row.,[40],[41],
,Drupal 6 was released on February 13, 2008,[42],, on March 5, 2009 Buytaert announced a ,code freeze, for Drupal 7 for September 1, 2009.,[43], Drupal 7 was released on January 5, 2011, with release parties in several countries.,[44], After that, maintenance on Drupal 5 stopped, with only Drupal 7 and Drupal 6 maintained.,[45], Drupal 7 series maintenance updates are released regularly.,[46],
,On October 7, 2015 Drupal 8 first release candidate (rc1) was announced.,[47], Drupal 8 includes new features and improvements for both users and developers, including: a revamped user interface; WYSIWYG and in-place editing; improved mobile support; added and improved key contributed modules including Views, Date, and Entity Reference; introduced a new object-oriented backend leveraging Symfony components; revamped configuration management; and improved multilingual support. Drupal 8 rc1 is the collective work of over 3,200 core contributors.,[48],
,Drupal 8.0.0 was released on November 19, 2015.,[49], Subsequent major and minor releases (,8.6.3, as of November 7, 2018) which bring numerous improvements and bug fixes (including CKEditor WYSIWYG enhancements, added APIs, an improved help page) can be found on the ,Releases, page.,[50],
,
,Core,[,edit,],
,In the Drupal community, ""CORE"" refers to the collaboratively built codebase that can be extended through contributory modules and for versions prior to Drupal 8 is kept outside of the ""sites"" folder of a Drupal installation.,[51], (Starting with version 8, core is kept in its own 'core' sub-directory.) Drupal core is the stock element of Drupal. Bootstrap and Common libraries are defined as Drupal core and all other functionality is defined as Drupal modules including the system module itself.
,In a Drupal website's default configuration, authors can contribute content as either registered or anonymous users (at the discretion of the administrator). This content is accessible to web visitors through a variety of selectable criteria. As of Drupal 8, Drupal has adopted some ,Symfony, libraries into Drupal core.
,Core modules also includes a hierarchical ,taxonomy, system, which lets developers categorize content  or ,tagged, with key words for easier access.,[22],
,Drupal maintains a detailed ,changelog, of core feature updates by version.,[52],
,
,Core modules,[,edit,],
,Drupal core includes optional modules that can be enabled by the administrator to extend the functionality of the core website.,[53],
,The core Drupal distribution provides a number of features, including:,[53],
,
,
,Access statistics and logging,
,Advanced search,
,Blogs, books, comments, forums, and polls,
,Caching and feature throttling for improved performance,
,Descriptive URLs,
,Multi-level menu system,
,Multi-site support,[54],
,Multi-user content creation and editing,
,OpenID, support,
,RSS feed and feed aggregator,
,Security and new release update notification,
,User profiles,
,Various access control restrictions (user roles, IP addresses, email),
,Workflow tools (triggers and actions),
,Core themes,[,edit,],
,Drupal includes core themes, which customize the ""look and feel"" of Drupal sites,,[55], for example, Garland and Bartik.
,The Color Module, introduced in Drupal core 5.0, allows administrators to change the color scheme of certain themes via a browser interface.,[56],
,
,Localization,[,edit,],
,As of  January 2017,[update],, Drupal had been made available in 100 languages and ,English, (the default).,[57], Support is included for right-to-left languages such as ,Arabic,, ,Persian,, and ,Hebrew,.,[58],
,Drupal localization is built on top of ,gettext,, the GNU ,internationalization and localization, (i18n) library.
,
,Auto-update notification,[,edit,],
,Drupal can automatically notify the administrator about new versions of modules, themes, or the Drupal core.,[58], It's important to update quickly after security updates are released. 
,Before updating it is highly recommended to take backup of core, modules, theme, files and database. If there is any error shown after update or new updates is not compatible with a module, then it can be quickly replace by backup. There are several backup modules available in Drupal. 
,On October 15, 2014, a sql injection vulnerability was announced and update released.,[59], Two weeks later the Drupal security team released an advisory explaining that everyone should act under the assumption that any site not updated within 7 hours of the announcement are infected.,[60], Thus, it can be extremely important to apply these updates quickly and usage of a tool to make this process easier like ,drush, is highly recommended.
,
,Database abstraction,[,edit,],
,Prior to version 7, Drupal had functions that performed tasks related to databases, such as SQL query cleansing, multi-site table name prefixing, and generating proper SQL queries. In particular, Drupal 6 introduced an abstraction layer that allowed programmers to create SQL queries without writing SQL.
,Drupal 7 extends the data abstraction layer so that a programmer no longer needs to write SQL queries as text strings. It uses ,PHP Data Objects, to abstract the database. ,Microsoft, has written a database driver for their ,SQL Server,.,[61], Drupal 7 supports the file-based ,SQLite, database engine, which is part of the standard PHP distribution.
,
,Windows development,[,edit,],
,With Drupal 7's new database abstraction layer, and ability to run on the Windows web server ,IIS,, it is now easier for Windows developers to participate in the Drupal community. 
,A group on Drupal.org is dedicated to Windows issues.,[62],
,
,Accessibility,[,edit,],
,With the release of Drupal 7, ,Web accessibility, has been greatly improved by the Drupal community.,[63],  Drupal is a good framework for building sites accessible to people with disabilities, because many of the best practices have been incorporated into the program code Core. The accessibility team is carrying on the work of identifying and resolving accessibility barriers and raising awareness within the community. 
,Drupal 7 started the adoption of ,WAI-ARIA, support for ,Rich Internet Applications, and this has been carried further in Drupal 8. There have been many improvements to both the visitor and administrator sides of Drupal, especially:
,
,Drag and drop functionality,
,Improved color contrast and intensity,
,Adding skip navigation to core themes,
,Adding labels by default for input forms,
,Fixing CSS display:none with consistent methods for hiding and exposing text on focus.,
,The community also added an accessibility gate for core issues in Drupal 8.,[64],
,
,Extending the core,[,edit,],
,Drupal core is ,modular,, defining a system of ,hooks, and ,callbacks,, which are accessed internally via an ,API,.,[65], This design allows third-party contributed ,modules, and ,themes, to extend or override Drupal's default behaviors without changing Drupal core's code.
,Drupal isolates core files from contributed modules and themes. This increases flexibility and security and allows administrators to cleanly upgrade to new releases without overwriting their site's customizations.,[66], The Drupal community has the saying, ""Never hack core,"" a strong recommendation that site developers do not change core files.,[51],
,
,Modules,[,edit,],
,Contributed modules offer such additional or alternate features as image galleries, custom content types and content listings, ,WYSIWYG, editors, private messaging, third-party integration tools,,[67], integrating with BPM portals,,[68], and more. As of  January 2017,[update], the Drupal website lists more than 36,500 free ,modules,.,[15],
,Some of the most commonly used contributed modules include:,[69],
,
,Content Construction Kit (CCK): allows site administrators to dynamically create content types by extending the database schema. ""Content type"" describes the kind of information. Content types include, but are not limited to, events, invitations, reviews, articles, and products. The CCK Fields API is in Drupal core in Drupal 7.,[70],[71],
,Views: facilitates the retrieval and presentation, through a database abstraction system, of content to site visitors. Basic views functionality has been added to core in Drupal 8.,[72],
,Panels: drag and drop layout manager that allows site administrators to visually design their site.,
,Rules: conditionally executed actions based on recurring events.,
,Features: enables the capture and management of features (entities, views, fields, configuration, etc.) into custom modules.,
,Context: allows definition of sections of site where Drupal features can be conditionally activated,
,Media: makes photo uploading and media management easier,
,Services: provides an API for Drupal.,
,Organic Groups Mailing List,
,Themes,[,edit,],
,As of  January 2017,[update],, there are more than 2,400,[16], free community-contributed ,themes,. Themes adapt or replace a Drupal site's default look and feel.
,Drupal themes use standardized formats that may be generated by common third-party theme design engines. Many are written in the ,PHPTemplate, engine,[73], or, to a lesser extent, the ,XTemplate, engine.,[74], Some templates use hard-coded ,PHP,. Drupal 8 will integrate the ,Twig, templating engine.
,The inclusion of the PHPTemplate and XTemplate engines in Drupal addressed user concerns about flexibility and complexity.,[75], The Drupal theming system utilizes a ,template engine, to further separate ,HTML,/,CSS, from PHP. A popular Drupal contributed module called 'Devel' provides GUI information to developers and themers about the page build.
,Community-contributed themes,[76], at the Drupal website are released under a free ,GPL, license,,[77], and the most installed Drupal themes are ,listed on this page,.,[78],
,
,Distributions,[,edit,],
,In the past, those wanting a fully customized installation of Drupal had to download a pre-tailored version separately from the official Drupal core. Today, however, a distribution defines a packaged version of Drupal that upon installation, provides a website or application built for a specific purpose.
,The distributions offer the benefit of a new Drupal site without having to manually seek out and install third-party contributed modules or adjust configuration settings.,[79], They are collections of modules, themes, and associated configuration settings that prepare Drupal for custom operation. For example, a distribution could configure Drupal as a ""brochure"" site rather than a news site or ,online store,.
,
,Architecture,[,edit,],
,Drupal is based on the ,Presentation Abstraction Control, architecture, or PAC. 
,The ,menu system, acts as the Controller. It accepts input via a single source (,HTTP GET, and ,POST,), routes requests to the appropriate helper functions, pulls data out of the Abstraction (nodes and, from Drupal 5 onwards, forms), and then pushes it through a filter to get a Presentation of it (the theme system). 
,It even has multiple, parallel PAC agents in the form of blocks that push data out to a common canvas (page.tpl.php).,[80],
,
,Community,[,edit,],
,Drupal.org has a large community of users and developers who provide active ,community, support by coming up with new updates to help improve the functionality of Drupal,,[81], As of  January 2017,[update], more than 105,400 users are actively contributing.,[14], The semiannual DrupalCon conference alternates between North America, Europe and Asia.,[82], Attendance at DrupalCon grew from 500 at ,Szeged, in August 2008, to over 3,700 people at Austin, Texas in June, 2014.
,Smaller events, known as ""Drupal Camps"" or DrupalCamp,,[83], occur throughout the year all over the world. The annual Florida DrupalCamp brings users together for ,Coding for a Cause, that benefits a local nonprofit organization, as does the annual GLADCamp (,Greater Los Angeles Drupal, Camp) event, ,Coders with a Cause,.
,The Drupal community also organizes professional and semi-professional gatherings called ,meetups, at a large number of venues around the world. In July, 2013, ,Droplabs,, a co-working space in Los Angeles, California, was recognized as the world's ""Top Drupal Location,[84],"" (with 62 recorded events) when compared with other event venues over a 12-month period.
,There are a number of active Drupal forums,,[85], mailing lists,[86], and discussion groups.,[87], Drupal also maintains several ,IRC, channels,[88], on the ,Freenode, network.
,There are over 30 national communities,[89], around drupal.org offering language-specific support.
,Notable Drupal users include ,NBC,, ,Taboola,, ,Patch,, and ,We the People,.,[90],
,
,Security,[,edit,],
,Drupal's policy is to announce the nature of each security vulnerability once the fix is released.,[91],[92],
,Administrators of Drupal sites are automatically notified of these new releases via the Update Status module (Drupal 6) or via the Update Manager (Drupal 7).,[93], 
,Drupal maintains a security announcement mailing list, a history of all security advisories,,[94], a security team home page,,[95], and an RSS feed,[96], with the most recent security advisories.
,In mid-October 2014,,[97], Drupal issued a ""highly critical"" security advisory regarding an ,SQL injection, bug in Drupal 7, also known as Drupalgeddon.,[98],[99],  
,Downloading and installing an upgrade to Drupal 7.32 fixes the vulnerability, but does not remove any ,backdoor, installed by hackers if the site has already been ,compromised,.,[100],  Attacks began soon after the vulnerability was announced. According to the Drupal security team, where a site was not patched within hours of the announcement, it should be considered compromised and taken offline by being replaced with a static HTML page while the administrator of its server must be told that other sites on the same server may also have been compromised. 
,To solve the problem, the site must be restored using backups from before October 15, be patched and manually updated, and anything merged from the site must be audited.,[101],
,In late March 2018, a patch for vulnerability ,CVE,-2018-7600, also dubbed ,Drupalgeddon2,, was released. The underlying bug allows remote attackers without special roles or permissions to take complete control of Drupal 6, 7, and 8 sites. Starting early April, large scale automated attacks against vulnerable sites were observed,,[102], and on April 20th, a high level of penetration of unpatched sites was reported.,[103],
,
,Criticism,[,edit,],
,This section needs to be ,updated,., Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.,  ,(December 2014),
,In an article,[104], about the adoption of Drupal by the Whitehouse.gov site, ,Slate, associate editor Chris Wilson,[105], lists some common criticisms of Drupal. Other criticisms have included:
,
,Usability:, Aspects of the Drupal 6 administration interface were confusing and intimidating to some, particularly for new administrators.,[106],[107],[108], According to Dries Buytaert, Drupal 7 addressed 90% of the problems identified by usability tests conducted at the Universities of Minnesota and Baltimore.,[109],[110], To achieve this, ,Acquia, (the company founded by the project lead of Drupal) hired ,user experience, designer Mark Boulton to work with the Drupal community to design an improved user interface for Drupal's administration interface.,[111], The majority of his team's design work has been implemented by the community in Drupal 7. The 2011 usability test results from the University of Minnesota Office of Information Technology show that all of the major usability problems identified in Drupal 6 are either vastly improved or non-existent in Drupal 7. However, some new usability problems were identified.,[112],[113], Since the release of Drupal 7 there are now various distributions and applications to enhance the Back-end Usability of Drupal such as Drupal Gardens,,[114], Open Enterprise,[115], and Mitkom Builder.,[116],
,Learning curve:, Some users describe Drupal as being difficult to master.,[117],[118], Drupal's many contributed modules can have overlapping functionality and have been reported as overwhelming to new users.,[119],
,Backward compatibility (for software development):, Prior to 7, Drupal did not commit to backward compatibility across major revisions.,[120], This means that module and theme developers may have to rework their code to make it compatible. However, Drupal's policy is to not change how it uses data. This means that data from previous versions is still usable without alteration in the new release.,[121],[122], Drupal documents any incompatibilities, allowing the user to make informed decisions about when and whether to upgrade. Upgrades from 8 to 9 and beyond will require substantially less effort."" ,[123],
,Performance/scalability:, In 2008, ,performance, tests between Drupal 6.1 and ,Joomla, 1.5 demonstrated that Drupal's pages were delivered ""significantly faster"" than those of Joomla.,[124], Despite this, arguments over speed persist.,[125], Drupal is likely to be slower than a special-purpose application for a given task. For example, ,WordPress, typically outperforms Drupal as a single-user blogging tool. Drupal positions itself for broader applications requirements that are outside the scope of more narrowly focused applications.,[126], Drupal offers ,caching, to store various page elements, the use of which resulted in a 508% improvement in one benchmark.,[127], When using Drupal's default Page Cache mechanism, the cached pages are delivered only to anonymous users, so contributed modules must be installed to allow caching content for logged in users.,[128],[129], Like performance, ,scalability, (the ability to add servers to handle growing numbers of visitors with consistent response) can become a concern on large, interactive sites. ,MySQL,'s query caching can help reduce the load on the database server caused by Drupal's high ,query rate,.,[130],[131], Drupal caches database schema ,metadata, as well as elements such as blocks, forms and menus.,[132], Drupal 7 increases performance in database queries and reduces PHP code usage.,[133],
,Integrability with hosting structures:, Because of Drupal's demanding query requirements, Drupal-based websites can quickly become very taxing to hosts whose databases reside on a machine separate from their ,HTTP server,. While the issue can normally be addressed by implementing aggressive ,caching, as described above, such methods may be unimplementable in cases where the host does not offer access to ,PHP accelerators, like ,XCache, or ,APC,. Drupal has plugins that facilitate similar caching without requiring special PHP extensions.,[134],[135],
,The Drupal core search is ineffective at searching content:,[,citation needed,], There are contributed modules that will greatly improve the search functionality on a Drupal website, but they are not easily accessible due to a high learning curve and the difficulty users have in general of finding the right module.,[,citation needed,], One of the faceted search options is ,Apache Solr, Search Integration module, however, the module requires a dedicated server or ,virtual private server, (VPS) to operate because Solr must run on a ,servlet, container, e.g. ,Tomcat,, ,Jetty, or ,Resin,. These requirements make it harder for a Drupal website to have a functional search feature. In response some companies have created Apache Solr ,SaaS, products.,
,Many published, yet incomplete or outdated modules,[136], While Drupal's site boasts over 30,000 downloadable modules, searching the Drupal module directory finds many that are incomplete abandoned projects and do not work at all, only work for an outdated version due to lack of backward compatibility, or are unusable due to serious bugs.  This is due to the open source nature of Drupal, and the fact that anyone is free to start a module and publish it on drupal.org.  Modules with an active maintenance team are often highly polished, secure, and nearly bug free. Recent changes to the drupal.org website now let users search for modules, themes, and distributions, while filtering results by stability. ,[137],
,Difficult to unit test:,[138], Drupal 7 doesn't follow MVC framework and stores all of its configurations in database and as a result, unit testing the code without touching the database becomes extremely difficult. As a result, developers have resorted to using integration testing frameworks such as Red Test or behavior-driven development framework such as Behat and Codeception. Drupal 8 has taken a great stride in making it easier for developers to write unit-testable code.,
,There have also been criticism that Drupal is moving closer to the Enterprise Market and leaving smaller sites behind. The ,Backdrop CMS, project was forked by Nate Haug and Jen Lampton from Drupal about 2 years into the Drupal 8 development cycle. They claimed that Drupal was moving ""closer to the Enterprise market"" and that many in the community wouldn't be able (or willing) to make the jump. At that time the code was quite similar to that of Drupal 7—it was before the adoption of ,Symfony,, before the removal of much code that was not ,object-oriented,, and before widespread rewrites of many subsystems. ,[139],

,This article is about the class of text editors. For the most popular current example, see ,GNU Emacs,.,
,Emacs,Editing multiple ,Dired, buffers in ,GNU Emacs,Developer(s),David A. Moon,Guy L. Steele Jr.,Richard M. Stallman,Initial release,1976,; 42 years ago, (,1976,),[1],[2],Stable release,26.1 ,(May 28, 2018,; 6 months ago, (,2018-05-28,),), ,[±],
,Written in,Lisp,, ,C,Operating system,Cross-platform,Type,Text editor,Website,www,.gnu,.org,/software,/emacs,/,
,Emacs, ,/,ˈ,iː,m,æ,k,s,/, is a family of ,text editors, that are characterized by their ,extensibility,.,[3], The manual for the most widely used variant,,[4], ,GNU Emacs,, describes it as ""the extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor"".,[5],  Development of the first Emacs began in the mid-1970s, and work on its direct descendant, GNU Emacs, continues actively as of  2018,[update],.
,Emacs has over 10,000 built-in commands (many of which are macros themselves) and its ,user interface, allows the user to combine these commands into ,macros, to automate work. Implementations of Emacs typically feature a dialect of the ,Lisp, programming language that provides a deep extension capability, allowing users and developers to write new commands and applications for the editor. Extensions have been written to ,manage email,, ,files,, ,outlines,, and ,RSS, feeds,,[6], as well as clones of ,ELIZA,, ,Pong,, ,Conway's Life,, ,Snake, and ,Tetris,.,[7],
,The original EMACS was written in 1976 by ,Carl Mikkelsen,, ,David A. Moon, and ,Guy L. Steele Jr., as a set of ,Editor MACroS, for the ,TECO, editor.,[2],[8],[9],[10],[11], It was inspired by the ideas of the TECO-macro editors TECMAC and TMACS.,[12],
,The most popular, and most ported, version of Emacs is GNU Emacs, which was created by ,Richard Stallman, for the ,GNU Project,.,[13], ,XEmacs, is a variant that ,branched, from GNU Emacs in 1991. GNU Emacs and XEmacs use similar Lisp dialects and are for the most part compatible with each other.
,Emacs is, along with ,vi,, one of the two main contenders in the traditional ,editor wars, of ,Unix, culture. Emacs is among the oldest ,free and open source, projects still under development.,[14],

,History,[,edit,],
,  ,Editing ,C, ,source code, in ,GNU Emacs,
,  ,Editing, compiling and executing ,C++, code from ,GNU Emacs,
,  ,The interface of Emacs was influenced by the design of the ,Symbolics, ,space-cadet keyboard,[15],
,Emacs development began during the 1970s at the ,MIT AI Lab,, whose ,PDP-6, and ,PDP-10, computers used the ,Incompatible Timesharing System, (ITS) ,operating system, that featured a default ,line editor, known as ,Tape Editor and Corrector, (TECO). Unlike most modern text editors, TECO used separate modes in which the user would either add text, edit existing text, or display the document. One could not place characters directly into a document by typing them into TECO, but would instead enter a character ('i') in the TECO command language telling it to switch to input mode, enter the required characters, during which time the edited text was not displayed on the screen, and finally enter a character (<esc>) to switch the editor back to command mode. (A similar technique was used to allow overtyping.) This behavior is similar to that of the program ,ed,.
,Richard Stallman, visited the ,Stanford AI Lab, in 1972 or 1974 and saw the lab's ,E, editor, written by Fred Wright.,[16], He was impressed by the editor's intuitive ,WYSIWYG, (What You See Is What You Get) behavior, which has since become the default behavior of most modern text editors. He returned to MIT where Carl Mikkelsen, a ,hacker, at the AI Lab, had added to TECO a combined display/editing mode called ,Control-R, that allowed the screen display to be updated each time the user entered a keystroke. Stallman reimplemented this mode to run efficiently and then added a ,macro, feature to the TECO display-editing mode that allowed the user to redefine any keystroke to run a TECO program.,[10],
,E had another feature that TECO lacked: random-access editing. TECO was a page-sequential editor that was designed for editing ,paper tape, on the ,PDP-1, and typically allowed editing on only one page at a time, in the order of the pages in the file. Instead of adopting E's approach of structuring the file for page-random access on disk, Stallman modified TECO to handle large buffers more efficiently and changed its file-management method to read, edit, and write the entire file as a single buffer. Almost all modern editors use this approach.
,The new version of TECO quickly became popular at the AI Lab and soon accumulated a large collection of custom macros whose names often ended in ,MAC, or ,MACS,, which stood for ,macro,. Two years later, ,Guy Steele, took on the project of unifying the diverse macros into a single set.,[17], Steele and Stallman's finished implementation included facilities for extending and documenting the new macro set.,[10], The resulting system was called EMACS, which stood for ,Editing MACroS, or, alternatively, ,E with MACroS,. Stallman picked the name Emacs ""because <E> was not in use as an abbreviation on ITS at the time."",[18], An apocryphal ,hacker koan, alleges that the program was named after ,Emack & Bolio's,, a popular ,Cambridge, ice cream store.,[19], The first operational EMACS system existed in late 1976.,[20],
,Stallman saw a problem in too much customization and ,de facto, forking and set certain conditions for usage.,[,citation needed,], He later wrote:,[20],
,
,""EMACS was distributed on a basis of communal sharing, which means all improvements must be given back to me to be incorporated and distributed."",
,The original Emacs, like TECO, ran only on the PDP-10 running ITS. Its behavior was sufficiently different from that of TECO that it could be considered a text editor in its own right, and it quickly became the standard editing program on ITS. ,Mike McMahon, ,ported, Emacs from ITS to the ,TENEX, and ,TOPS-20, operating systems. Other contributors to early versions of Emacs include ,Kent Pitman,, ,Earl Killian,, and ,Eugene Ciccarelli,. By 1979, Emacs was the main editor used in MIT's AI lab and its Laboratory for Computer Science.,[21],
,
,Other early implementations,[,edit,],
,In the following years, programmers wrote a variety of Emacs-like editors for other computer systems. These included ,EINE, (,EINE Is Not EMACS,) and ,ZWEI,[22], (,ZWEI Was EINE Initially,), which were written for the ,Lisp machine, by ,Mike McMahon, and ,Daniel Weinreb,, and Sine (,Sine Is Not Eine,),,[23], which was written by Owen Theodore Anderson. Weinreb's ,EINE, was the first Emacs written in Lisp. In 1978, ,Bernard Greenberg, wrote ,Multics Emacs, almost entirely in Multics Lisp at ,Honeywell,'s Cambridge Information Systems Lab. Multics Emacs was later maintained by ,Richard Soley,, who went on to develop the NILE Emacs-like editor for the NIL Project, and by Barry Margolin. Many versions of Emacs, including GNU Emacs, would later adopt Lisp as an extension language.
,James Gosling,, who would later invent ,NeWS, and the ,Java programming language,, wrote ,Gosling Emacs, in 1981. The first Emacs-like editor to run on ,Unix,, Gosling Emacs was written in ,C, and used ,Mocklisp,, a language with Lisp-like syntax, as an extension language.

,Richard Stallman began work on GNU Emacs in 1984 to produce a ,free software, alternative to the proprietary Gosling Emacs. GNU Emacs was initially based on Gosling Emacs, but Stallman's replacement of its Mocklisp interpreter with a true Lisp interpreter required that nearly all of its code be rewritten. This became the first program released by the nascent GNU Project. GNU Emacs is written in C and provides ,Emacs Lisp,, also implemented in C, as an extension language. Version 13, the first public release, was made on March 20, 1985. The first widely distributed version of GNU Emacs was version 15.34, released later in 1985. Early versions of GNU Emacs were numbered as ,1.x.x,, with the initial digit denoting the version of the C core. The ,1, was dropped after version 1.12, as it was thought that the major number would never change, and thus the numbering skipped from ,1, to ,13,.,[24], In September 2014, it was announced on the GNU emacs-devel mailing list that GNU Emacs would adopt a ,rapid release, strategy and version numbers would increment more quickly in the future.,[25],
,GNU Emacs was later ported to Unix. It offered more features than Gosling Emacs, in particular a full-featured Lisp as its extension language, and soon replaced Gosling Emacs as the ,de facto, Unix Emacs editor. ,Markus Hess, exploited a security flaw in GNU Emacs' email subsystem in his 1986 cracking spree in which he gained ,superuser, access to Unix computers.,[26],
,GNU Emacs uses a layered architecture, with a ,Turing complete, language running on top of a smaller central core.  Because about 70% of GNU Emacs is written in the Elisp extension language,,[27], and the set of features implemented in Elisp code are automatically present once the C core (which implements the Elisp interpreter, weighing 247 kLOC as of version 24.4) has been ported, porting Emacs to a new platform is considerably less difficult than porting an equivalent project consisting of native code only.  Theoretically, only the core must be ported to the new platform; once the core is ported, the portions implemented in the language above take minimal work to bring over.
,GNU Emacs development was relatively closed until 1999 and was used as an example of the ,Cathedral, development style in ,The Cathedral and the Bazaar,. The project has since adopted a public development mailing list and anonymous ,CVS, access. Development took place in a single CVS trunk until 2008 and was then switched to the Bazaar ,DVCS,. On November 11, 2014, development was moved to ,Git,.,[28],
,Richard Stallman has remained the principal maintainer of GNU Emacs, but he has stepped back from the role at times. Stefan Monnier and Chong Yidong were maintainers from 2008-2015.,[29],[30], John Wiegley was named maintainer in 2015 after a meeting with Stallman at MIT.,[31], As of early 2014, GNU Emacs has had 579 individual ,committers, throughout its history.,[32],
,
,XEmacs,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,XEmacs,
,  ,XEmacs, 21.5 on ,GNU,/,Linux,
,Lucid Emacs, based on an early alpha version of GNU Emacs 19, was developed beginning in 1991 by ,Jamie Zawinski, and others at ,Lucid Inc., One of the best-known early forks in ,free software, development occurred when the codebases of the two Emacs versions diverged and the separate development teams ceased efforts to merge them back into a single program.,[33], Lucid Emacs has since been renamed ,XEmacs, and remains the second most popular variety of Emacs, after GNU Emacs.,[,citation needed,], XEmacs development has slowed, with the most recent stable version 21.4.22 released in January 2009 (while a beta was released in 2013), while GNU Emacs has implemented many formerly XEmacs-only features. This has led some users to proclaim XEmacs' death.,[34],
,
,Other forks of GNU Emacs,[,edit,],
,Other forks, less known than XEmacs, include:
,
,Remacs – a port of GNU Emacs to the ,Rust, programming language.,[35],
,Meadow, – a Japanese version for Microsoft Windows,[36],
,SXEmacs, – Steve Youngs' fork of XEmacs,[37],
,Aquamacs, – based on GNU Emacs (Aquamacs 3.2 is based on GNU Emacs version 24 and Aquamacs 3.3 is based on GNU Emacs version 25) which focuses on integrating with the Apple Macintosh user interface,
,Various Emacs editors,[,edit,],
,  ,The ,mg, tiny Emacs-like editor in ,OpenBSD, 5.3. Editing ,Ruby, ,source code,
,  ,Zmacs,, an Emacs for ,Lisp machines,
,In the past, projects aimed at producing small versions of Emacs proliferated. GNU Emacs was initially targeted at computers with a 32-bit flat address space and at least 1 ,MiB, of RAM.  Such computers were high end ,workstations, and ,minicomputers, in the 1980s, and this left a need for smaller reimplementations that would run on common ,personal computer, hardware.  In more recent times, small clones have been designed to fit on software installation disks.,[,citation needed,],
,Other projects aim to implement Emacs in a different dialect of Lisp or a different programming language altogether.  Although not all are still actively maintained, these clones include:
,
,MicroEMACS,, which was originally written by Dave Conroy and further developed by Daniel Lawrence and which exists in many variations.,
,mg,, originally called MicroGNUEmacs and, later, mg2a, a public-domain offshoot of MicroEMACS intended to more closely resemble GNU Emacs. Now installed by default on ,OpenBSD,.,
,NotGNU,,[38], a small, fast, proprietary ,freeware, implementation for DOS, Win16, Win32 and Linux by Julie Melbin.,
,JOVE, (Jonathan's Own Version of Emacs), Jonathan Payne's non-programmable Emacs implementation for ,UNIX-like, systems.,
,MINCE, (MINCE Is Not Complete Emacs), a version for CP/M and later DOS, from ,Mark of the Unicorn,. MINCE evolved into Final Word, which eventually became the Borland ,Sprint, word processor.,
,Perfect Writer,, a ,CP/M, implementation derived from MINCE that was included circa 1982 as the default word processor with the very earliest releases of the Kaypro II and Kaypro IV. It was later provided with the Kaypro 10 as an alternative to ,WordStar,.,
,Freemacs,, a ,DOS, version that uses an extension language based on text macro expansion and fits within the original 64 ,KiB, flat memory limit.,
,Zile,. Zile was a recursive acronym for ,Z,ile ,I,s ,L,ossy, ,E,macs,,,[39], but the project was rewritten in ,Lua, and now gives the expansion as Zile Implements Lua Editors. The new Zile still includes an implementation of Emacs in Lua called Zemacs. There is also an implementation of vi called Zi.,
,Zmacs,, for the MIT ,Lisp Machine, and its descendants, implemented in ,ZetaLisp,.,
,Climacs,, a Zmacs-influenced variant implemented in ,Common Lisp,.,
,QEmacs,,,[40], a small editor by ,Fabrice Bellard, with UTF-8 capability that can quickly edit files as large as hundreds of MiB in size.,
,Epsilon,,,[41], an Emacs clone by Lugaru Software. Versions for DOS, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X and O/S 2 are bundled in the release. It uses a non-Lisp extension language with C syntax and used a very early concurrent command shell buffer implementation under the single-tasking MS-DOS.,
,PceEmacs, is the Emacs-based editor for ,SWI-Prolog,.,
,EmACT,, a 1986 fork of MicroEmacs by Christian Jullien. EmACT,[42], source code is available at SourceForge.,
,Amacs,, an Apple II ProDOS version of Emacs implemented in 6502 assembly by ,Brian Fox,.,[43],[44],
,Hemlock,, originally written in ,Spice Lisp,, then ,Common Lisp,. A part of ,CMU Common Lisp,. Influenced by ,Zmacs,. Later forked by Lucid Common Lisp (as Helix), ,LispWorks, and ,Clozure CL, projects. There is also a Portable Hemlock project, which aims to provide a Hemlock, which runs on several Common Lisp implementations.,
,umacs,,,[45], an implementation under ,OS-9,
,Editors with Emacs emulation,[,edit,],
,Yi,, an editor that is written and extensible in ,Haskell, and has an emulation mode for Emacs.,
,Joe's Own Editor, emulates Emacs keybindings when invoked as ,jmacs,.,
,JED, has an emulation mode for Emacs.,
,Eclipse (IDE), provides a set of Emacs keybindings.,
,IntelliJ IDEA, provides a set of Emacs keybindings.,
,Epsilon (text editor), Defaults to Emacs emulation and supports a vi mode.,
,The ,Cocoa text system, uses some of the same terminology and understands many Emacs navigation bindings. This is possible because the native UI uses the ,Command key, (equivalent to Super) instead of the ,Control key,.,[46],
,Sublime Text, can emulate some of Emacs' behavior with the SublemacsPro plugin.,[47],
,Visual Studio Emacs Keys, provides a set of Emacs keybindings for Visual Studio users,
,GNU Readline, is a ,line editor, that understands the standard Emacs navigation keybindings. It also has a ,vi, emulation mode.,
,GNOME Builder, has an emulation mode for Emacs.,
,Features,[,edit,],
,Emacs is primarily a ,text editor, and is designed for manipulating pieces of text, although it is capable of formatting and printing documents like a ,word processor, by interfacing with external programs such as ,LaTeX,, ,Ghostscript, or a web browser. Emacs provides commands to manipulate and ,differentially display, ,semantic, units of text such as ,words,, ,sentences,, ,paragraphs, and ,source code, constructs such as ,functions,. It also features ,keyboard macros, for performing user-defined batches of editing commands.
,GNU Emacs is a ,real-time display, editor, as its edits are displayed onscreen as they occur. This is standard behavior for modern text editors but EMACS was among the earliest to implement this functionality instead of having to issue a separate command to insert new edits into the existing text as in vi.
,
,General architecture,[,edit,],
,Almost all of the functionality in Emacs, including basic editing operations such as the insertion of characters into a document, is achieved through ,functions, written in ,Emacs Lisp, (ELisp), a dialect of the ,Lisp programming language,. The ELisp layer sits atop a stable core of basic services and platform abstraction written in the ,C programming language,. In this Lisp environment, ,variables, and ,functions, can be modified with no need to recompile or restart Emacs.
,Emacs operates on ,data structures, called ,buffers, containing text with additional attributes; every buffer maintains its own ,point, (cursor location) and ,mark, (another location, delimiting the selected ,region, together with the ,point,), the name of the file it is ,visiting, (if applicable) and the set of active ,modes, (exactly one ,major mode,[,clarification needed,], and any number of ,minor modes,[,clarification needed,],), which control editor behaviour through variables. Elisp code can be executed interactively through named ,commands,, which can be bound to key presses or accessed by name; some commands evaluate arbitrary Elisp code from buffers (e.g. ,eval-region, or ,eval-buffer,).
,Buffers are displayed in ,windows,, which are tiled portions of the terminal screen or the GUI window (called a ,frame, in Emacs terms; multiple frames are possible). Unless configured otherwise, windows include scroll bars, line numbers, a ,header line, at the top (usually displaying the buffer title or filename) and a ,mode line, at the bottom (usually listing the active modes and point position of the buffer).
,Multiple windows can be opened onto the same buffer, for example to see different parts of a long text, and multiple buffers can share the same text, for example to take advantage of different major modes in a mixed-language file. The mode can also be changed manually as needed with ,M-x <mode name>,.
,
,Customizability,[,edit,],
,Keystrokes can be recorded into macros and replayed to automate complex, repetitive tasks. This is often done on an ad-hoc basis, with each macro discarded after use, although macros can be saved and invoked later.,
,At startup, Emacs executes an Emacs Lisp script named ,~/.emacs, (recent versions also look for ,~/emacs.el, and ,~/.emacs.d/init.el,;,[48], Emacs will execute the first one it finds, ignoring the rest). This personal customization file can be arbitrarily long and complex, but typical content includes:
,Setting global variables or invoking functions to customize Emacs behaviour, for example ,(set-default-coding-systems 'utf-8),
,Key bindings, to override standard ones and to add shortcuts for commands that the user finds convenient but don't have a key binding by default. Example: ,(global-set-key (kbd ""C-x C-b"") 'ibuffer),
,Loading, enabling and initializing extensions (Emacs comes with many extensions, but only a few are loaded by default.),
,Configuring ,event hooks, to run arbitrary code at specific times, for example to automatically recompile source code after saving a buffer (,after-save-hook,),
,Executing arbitrary files, usually to split an overly long configuration file into manageable and homogeneous parts (,~/.emacs.d/, and ,~/elisp/, are traditional locations for these personal scripts),
,The ,customize, extension allows the user to set configuration properties such as the color scheme interactively, from within Emacs, in a more user-friendly way than by setting variables in ,.emacs,: it offers search, descriptions and help text, multiple choice inputs, reverting to defaults, modification of the running Emacs instance without reloading, and other conveniences similar to the ,preferences, functionality of other programs. The customized values are saved in ,.emacs, (or another designated file) automatically.,
,Themes,, affecting the choice of fonts and colours, are defined as elisp files and chosen through the customize extension.,
,Self-documenting,[,edit,],
,The first Emacs contained a ,help, library that included documentation for every command, variable and internal function. Because of this, Emacs proponents described the software as ,self-documenting, in that it presents the user with information on its normal features and its current state. Each function includes a documentation string that is displayed to the user on request, a practice that subsequently spread to programming languages including ,Lisp,, ,Java,, ,Perl,, and ,Python,. This help system can take users to the actual code for each function, whether from a built-in library or an added third-party library.
,Emacs also has a built-in ,tutorial,. Emacs displays instructions for performing simple editing commands and invoking the tutorial when it is launched with no file to edit. The tutorial is by Stuart Cracraft and Richard Stallman.
,
,Culture,[,edit,],
,Church of Emacs,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Editor war,
,  ,Richard Stallman, as St I,GNUcius,, a saint in the ,Church of Emacs,
,The ,Church of Emacs,, formed by ,Richard Stallman,, is a ,parody religion, created for Emacs users.,[49], While it refers to ,vi, as the ,editor of the beast, (vi-vi-vi being ,6-6-6, in Roman numerals), it does not oppose the use of vi; rather, it calls ,proprietary software, ,anathema,. (""Using a ,free, version of vi is not a sin but a ,penance,."",[50],) The Church of Emacs has its own ,newsgroup,, ,alt.religion.emacs,,,[51], that has posts purporting to support this parody religion. Supporters of vi have created an opposing ,Cult of vi,.
,Stallman has jokingly referred to himself as ,St I ,GNU, cius,, a saint in the Church of Emacs.,[52],
,
,Emacs pinky,[,edit,],
,There is folklore attributing a ,repetitive strain injury, colloquially called ,Emacs ,pinky, to Emacs' strong dependence on modifier keys,,[53], although there have not been any studies done to show Emacs causes more such problems than other keyboard-heavy computer programs.
,Users have addressed this through various approaches. Some users recommend simply using the two Control keys on typical PC keyboards like Shift keys while touch typing to avoid overly straining the left pinky.,[54], Software-side methods include:,[55],
,
,Customizing the key layout so that the Control key is transposed with the caps lock key.,[56], Similar techniques include defining the caps lock key as an additional Control key or transposing the Control and Meta keys.,This technique has also been specifically recommended ,against, as ,contributing, to Emacs pinky.,[,clarification needed,],
,Software, such as xwrits or the built-in ,type-break-mode, in Emacs, that reminds the user to take regularly scheduled breaks.,
,Using the ErgoEmacs keybindings (with minor mode ,ergoemacs-mode,).,[57],[58],
,Customizing the whole keyboard layout to move statistically frequent Emacs keys to more appropriate places.,[59],
,Packages such as ,ace-jump-mode,[60], or elisp extensions that provide similar functionality of tiered navigation, first asking for a character then replacing occurrences of the character with access keys for cursor movement.,
,evil-mode,, an advanced ,Vim, emulation layer.,
,god-mode,, which provides an approach similar to vim's with a mode for entering Emacs commands without modifier keys.,
,Using customized key layout offered by ,Spacemacs,, a project where ,Space, key is used as the main key for initiating control sequences. The project also heavily incorporates both ,evil-mode, and ,god-mode,.,[61],
,StickyKeys,, which turns key sequences into key combinations.,[62],
,Emacs' built-in ,viper-mode, that allows use of the ,vi, key layout for basic text editing and the Emacs scheme for more advanced features.,[63],
,Giving a dual role to a more-comfortably accessed key such as the ,Space bar, so that it functions as a Control key when pressed in combination with other keys. ,Ergonomic keyboards, or keyboards with a greater number of keys adjacent to the space bar, such as ,Japanese keyboards,, allow thumb control of other modifier keys too like Meta or Shift.,[64],
,Using a limited ergonomic subset of keybindings, and accessing other functionality by typing ,M-x <command-name>,. M-x itself can also be rebound.,
,Driving Emacs through voice input.,
,Hardware solutions include special keyboards such as ,Kinesis's Contoured Keyboard,, which places the modifier keys where they can easily be operated by the ,thumb,, or the ,Microsoft Natural keyboard,, whose large modifier keys are placed symmetrically on both sides of the keyboard and can be pressed with the palm of the hand.,[53], Foot pedals can also be used.
,The ,Emacs pinky, is a relatively recent development. The ,Space-cadet keyboard, on which Emacs was developed had oversized Control keys that were adjacent to the space bar and were easy to reach with the thumb.,[65],
,
,Terminology,[,edit,],
,The word ,emacs, is sometimes pluralized as ,emacsen,, by phonetic analogy with ,boxen, and ,VAXen,, referring to different varieties of Emacs.,[66],
,
,Emacs in popular culture,[,edit,],
,In the movie, ,The Internship (2013),, at 01:21:01, Nick Campbell asks, ""It occurred to me, why not use Emacs rather than vi as the default editor for Ubuntu?"" to which Dana replies, ""That's actually a very good thought, Nick."",[67],
,On the television series, ,Silicon Valley Season 3, episode 6,, Richard asks, ""I mean, why not just use Vim over Emacs?"", to which Winnie replies, ""I do use Vim over Emacs."", to which Richard responds, ""Oh, God, help us!"",[68],

,Personal life,[,edit,],
,Buterin was born in ,Kolomna,, ,Moscow Oblast,, ,Russia,, to Dmitry Buterin, a computer scientist,,[4], and Natalia Ameline (née Chistyakova). He lived in the area until the age of six when his parents emigrated to ,Canada, in search of better employment opportunities.,[5], While in grade three of elementary school in Canada, Buterin was placed into a class for gifted children,[6], and started to understand that he was drawn to math, programming, and economics. He also had the ability to add three-digit numbers in his head at twice the speed of his peers.,[5],
,Buterin attended the ,Abelard School,, a private high school in Toronto, for four years,,[7], which he said, ""proved to be among the most interesting and productive years of my life; the closer connection between students and teachers [&] the level of depth at which the material was taught, made me want to learn, and to focus on learning as my primary goal"".,[7], Buterin has written that although he was ""never particularly inspired by the traditional education system"",,[7], when subjects were presented with ""dedication and focus on intellectual inquiry"", he said:
,
,""I noticed my attitude and my results almost immediately and drastically change. Education is ultimately much more than simply memorizing individual facts, or even learning individual concepts. [What] matters most: learning how to think, learning how to reason and learning how to learn."",[7],
,Buterin learned about Bitcoin, from his father, at age 17.,[5], In 2012, he obtained a bronze medal in the International Olympiad in Informatics.,[8], In 2013, he visited developers in other countries who shared his enthusiasm for code. He returned to Toronto later that year and published a ,white paper, proposing Ethereum.,[9], He attended the ,University of Waterloo, but dropped out in 2014, when he received the ,Thiel Fellowship, in the amount of $100,000,,[10], and went to work on Ethereum full-time.,[10],
,On June 25, 2017, Buterin was the subject of a ,death hoax, originating from ,4chan,.,[11],
,On 30 November 2018, Vitalik Buterin receives Honorary Doctorate from the Faculty of Business and Economics of the University of Basel on the occasion of the Dies Academicus. ,[12],
,
,Career,[,edit,],
,Beginnings at ,Bitcoin Magazine,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Bitcoin Magazine,
,Buterin met a person on a bitcoin chat forum trying to start a bitcoin blog. The owner offered five bitcoin (about $3.50) to anyone who would write an article for him. Buterin wrote for the site until its website shut down soon thereafter due to Bitcoin's lack of mainstream attention.,[13],
,In September 2011, another person reached out to Buterin about a new publication called ,Bitcoin Magazine,, a position which Buterin would accept as the first co-founder, and contribute as a leading writer.,[14],
,In addition Buterin wrote about bitcoin-related topics for other publications, including ,Bitcoin Weekly,.,[1],[15], ,Bitcoin Magazine, in 2012 later began publishing a print edition and has been referred to as the first serious publication dedicated to cryptocurrencies.,[16], ,Bitcoin Magazine, was then purchased by ,BTC Media,, where Buterin continued to write until mid-2014.,[,citation needed,],
,In addition, he held a position on the editorial board of ,Ledger,, a peer-reviewed scholarly journal that publishes full-length original research articles on the subjects of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.,[17],
,
,Ethereum,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Ethereum,
,Buterin is a co-founder and inventor of Ethereum, described as a ""decentralised mining network and software development platform rolled into one"",[18], that facilitates the creation of new cryptocurrencies and programs that share a single ,blockchain, (a cryptographic transaction ledger).,[19],[20],
,Buterin first described Ethereum in a white paper,[21], in late 2013. Buterin argued that bitcoin needed a scripting language for application development. But when he failed to gain agreement, he proposed development of a new platform with a more general scripting language.,[22],:,88, About the Ethereum Project, Buterin has said: ""I am truly grateful to have the opportunity to work in such an interesting and interdisciplinary area of industry, where I have the chance to interact with cryptographers, mathematicians and economists prominent in their fields, to help build software and tools that already affect tens of thousands of people around the world, and to work on advanced problems in computer science, economics and philosophy every week."",[7],
,
,Open source software,[,edit,],
,Buterin has contributed as a developer to other open source software projects.,[1], Some early examples are: Kryptokit, pybitcointools, multisig.info, and btckeysplit.,[23], He also contributed to DarkWallet,[24], by ,Cody Wilson,, ,Bitcoin, ,Python, libraries,,[25], and the ,cryptocurrency, marketplace site Egora.,[2],
,
,Ethereum Russia,[,edit,],
,As Buterin was recognizing the economic and political relevance of the Ethereum enterprise for his native Russia, he talked shortly with ,Vladimir Putin, on June 2nd 2017, at the ,St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, (SPIEF) event. The president of Russia stated that he ""supported the idea of establishing ties with possible Russian partners"".,[26],

 本页面最后修订于2018年7月13日 (星期五) 18:40。,"终身仁慈独裁者,（,英语：,Benevolent Dictator For Life,，缩写,BDFL,）是少数,开源软件,开发者所拥有的头衔。他们通常是某一项目的创始人，并在该项目社区出现争议时拥有最终的决定权。这一称号诞生于1995年，最初用来指,Python语言,的创始人,吉多·范罗苏姆,。,[1],[2],当时在范罗苏姆刚加入,全国研究创新联合会,（,英语,：,Corporation for National Research Initiatives,）,后，,肯马·内梅尔,（,英语,：,Ken Manheimer,）,在一封邮件中试图创立一个监管Python语言开发的半正式团体。他在该邮件中首次使用了BDFL这一称呼，并戏称范罗苏姆为“首任临时BDFL”。,[1],2018年7月12日，范罗苏姆宣布不再出任Python语言的BDFL。,[3],
,值得一提的是，BDFL与另一个用来指开源运动领导人的称呼“仁慈的独裁者”（benevolent dictator）的含义并不一致。后者因,埃里克·雷蒙,的《,开拓智域,》（Homesteading the Noosphere）一文而广为人知。雷蒙在文中提到，开源软件运动的本质会促使“独裁者”保持仁慈，否则巨大的分歧会导致项目被,复刻,并由新的领导所掌管。,[4],

" 24 September 2018, at 18:13","The ,Corporation for National Research Initiatives, (,CNRI,), based in ,Reston, Virginia,, is a ,non-profit organization, founded in 1986 by ,Robert E. Kahn, as an ""activities center around strategic development of network-based information technologies"", including the ,National Information Infrastructure, (NII) in the ,United States,.,[1],
,CNRI develops the ,Handle System, for managing and locating digital information.,[2],  CNRI obtained ,DARPA, funding for the development of JPython (,Jython,), a Python implementation in and for Java, initially created by ,Jim Hugunin,.,[3],

,History,[,edit,],
,CNRI formerly operated the Secretariat of the ,Internet Engineering Task Force,.,[4], ,Guido van Rossum,, pioneer for open source software and creator of Python, at one time worked for this company. The formation and early funding of the ,Internet Society, were led by CNRI. At the first meeting of the Internet Society board, Vint Cerf, representing CNRI, offered, ""In the event a deficit occurs, CNRI has agreed to contribute up to USD102000 to offset it."",[5], In the event, the contribution was not needed. CNRI did cover many of the expenses of the Internet Society in 1992. They also paid Cerf's salary during 1993, when much of his time was devoted to building the Internet Society.,[6],
,
,Handle System,[,edit,],
,In 1996, the ,Association of American Publishers, announced that ,R.R. Bowker, and the CNRI had been selected to design a ,Digital Object Identifier, system. The effort was initiated after a year-long study of the need for a system to identify electronic copyright ownership and to manage the digital purchase of rights.,[7],  The CNRI Handle system was first demonstrated at a February 1997 meeting of the Professional/Scholarly Publishing (PSP) division of the AAP meeting in Washington, DC.,[8], The ,Handle System, is a technology specification for assigning, managing, and resolving ,persistent identifiers, for digital objects and other resources on the Internet. The DONA System is under consideration at the ,ITU,[9], and has been adopted by several countries.,[10],
,
,D-Lib,[,edit,],
,D-Lib Magazine, was an on-line magazine dedicated to digital library research and development, produced by CNRI.
,
,Software,[,edit,],
,DO Repository and DO Registry,[,edit,],
,CNRI developed the Digital Object (DO) Repository software, with digital object architecture which provides a mechanism for the creation of, and access to, digital objects as discrete data structures with unique, resolvable identifiers.,[11],

,The ,hacker culture, is a ,subculture, of individuals who enjoy the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming limitations of ,software systems, to achieve novel and clever outcomes.,[1], The act of engaging in activities (such as programming or other media,[2],) in a spirit of playfulness and exploration is termed ""hacking"". However, the defining characteristic of a ,hacker, is not the activities performed themselves (e.g. ,programming,), but the manner in which it is done,[3], and whether it is something exciting and meaningful.,[2], Activities of playful cleverness can be said to have ""hack value"" and therefore the term ""hacks"" came about,,[3], with early examples including ,pranks at MIT, done by students to demonstrate their technical aptitude and cleverness. Therefore, the hacker culture originally emerged in academia in the 1960s around the ,Massachusetts Institute of Technology, (MIT)'s ,Tech Model Railroad Club, (TMRC),[4], and ,MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,.,[5], Hacking originally involved entering restricted areas in a clever way without causing any major damages. Some famous ,hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, were placing of a campus police cruiser on the roof of the Great Dome and converting the Great Dome into ,R2-D2,.,[6],
,Richard Stallman, explains about hackers who program:

,.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0},What they had in common was mainly love of excellence and programming. They wanted to make their programs that they used be as good as they could. They also wanted to make them do neat things. They wanted to be able to do something in a more exciting way than anyone believed possible and show ""Look how wonderful this is. I bet you didn't believe this could be done."",[7],
,
,Hackers from this subculture tend to emphatically differentiate themselves from what they pejoratively call "",crackers,""; those who are generally referred to by media and members of the general public using the term ""hacker"", and whose primary focus‍—‌be it to malign or for malevolent purposes‍—‌lies in ,exploiting, weaknesses in computer security.,[8],

,Definition,
,The ,Jargon File,, an influential but not universally accepted compendium of hacker slang, defines hacker as ""A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and stretching their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary."",[9], The ,Request for Comments, (RFC) 1392, the Internet Users' Glossary, amplifies this meaning as ""A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular."",[10],
,As documented in the Jargon File, these hackers are disappointed by the mass media and general public's usage of the word ,hacker, to refer to ,security breakers,, calling them ""crackers"" instead. This includes both ""good"" crackers ("",white hat hackers,"") who use their computer security related skills and knowledge to learn more about how systems and networks work and to help to discover and fix security holes, as well as those more ""evil"" crackers ("",black hat hackers,"") who use the same skills to author harmful software (like viruses, trojans, etc.) and illegally infiltrate secure systems with the intention of doing harm to the system.,[11], The programmer subculture of hackers, in contrast to the cracker community, generally sees computer security related activities as contrary to the ideals of the original and true meaning of the hacker term that instead related to playful cleverness.,[11],
,
,History,
,The word ""hacker"" derives from the seventeenth-century word of a ""lusty laborer"" who harvested fields by dogged and rough swings of his hoe. Although the idea of ""hacking"" has existed long before the term ""hacker""‍—‌with the most notable example of ,Lightning Ellsworth,, it was not a word that the first programmers used to describe themselves. In fact, many of the first programmers were from engineering or physics backgrounds. 
,
,

,
,“
,
,""But from about 1945 onward (and especially during the creation of the first ENIAC computer) some programmers realized that their expertise in computer software and technology had evolved not just into a profession, but into a passion"" (46).,[1],
,
,”
,
,
,
,
,There was a growing awareness of a style of programming different from the cut and dried methods employed at first,,[12],[13], but it was not until the 1960s that the term hackers began to be used to describe proficient computer programmers. Therefore, the fundamental characteristic that links all who identify themselves as hackers are ones who enjoy ""…the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming and circumventing limitations of programming systems and who tries to extend their capabilities"" (47).,[1], With this definition in mind, it can be clear where the negative implications of the word ""hacker"" and the subculture of ""hackers"" came from.
,Some common nicknames among this culture include ""crackers"" who are unskilled thieves who mainly rely on luck. Others include ""phreak""‍—‌which refers to a type of skilled ,crackers, and ""warez d00dz""‍—‌which is a kind of cracker that acquires reproductions of copyrighted software. Within all hackers are tiers of hackers such as the ""samurai"" who are hackers that hire themselves out for legal electronic locksmith work. Furthermore, there are other hackers who are hired to test security, they are called ""sneakers"" or ""tiger teams"".
,Before communications between computers and computer users were as ,networked, as they are now, there were multiple independent and parallel hacker subcultures, often unaware or only partially aware of each other's existence. All of these had certain important traits in common:
,
,Creating software and sharing it with each other,
,Placing a high value on freedom of inquiry,
,Hostility to secrecy,
,Information-sharing as both an ideal and a practical strategy,
,Upholding the right to ,fork,
,Emphasis on rationality,
,Distaste for authority,
,Playful cleverness, taking the serious humorously and humor seriously,
,  ,The ,Glider,, proposed as an ,emblem of the ""hacker community"", by ,Eric S. Raymond,.,[14],
,These sorts of subcultures were commonly found at ,academic, settings such as ,college, ,campuses,. The ,MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,, the ,University of California, Berkeley, and ,Carnegie Mellon University, were particularly well-known hotbeds of early hacker culture. They evolved in parallel, and largely unconsciously, until the ,Internet,, where a legendary ,PDP-10, machine at MIT, called AI, that was running ,ITS,, provided an early meeting point of the hacker community. This and other developments such as the rise of the ,free software movement, and ,community, drew together a critically large population and encouraged the spread of a conscious, common, and systematic ethos. Symptomatic of this evolution were an increasing adoption of ,common slang, and a shared view of history, similar to the way in which other occupational groups have professionalized themselves but without the formal credentialing process characteristic of most professional groups.,[,citation needed,],
,Over time, the academic hacker subculture has tended to become more conscious, more cohesive, and better organized. The most important consciousness-raising moments have included the composition of the first ,Jargon File, in 1973, the promulgation of the ,GNU Manifesto, in 1985, and the publication of ,Eric Raymond,'s ,The Cathedral and the Bazaar, in 1997. Correlated with this has been the gradual recognition of a set of shared culture heroes, including: ,Bill Joy,, ,Donald Knuth,, ,Dennis Ritchie,, ,Alan Kay,, ,Ken Thompson,, ,Richard M. Stallman,, ,Linus Torvalds,, ,Larry Wall,, and ,Guido Van Rossum,.
,The concentration of academic hacker subculture has paralleled and partly been driven by the commoditization of computer and networking technology, and has, in turn, accelerated that process. In 1975, hackerdom was scattered across several different families of ,operating systems, and disparate networks; today it is largely a ,Unix, and ,TCP/IP, phenomenon, and is concentrated around various ,operating systems, based on ,free software, and ,open-source software, development.
,
,Ethics and principles,
,Main article: ,Hacker ethic,
,Many of the values and tenets of the free and open source software movement stem from the ,hacker ethics, that originated at ,MIT,[15], and at the ,Homebrew Computer Club,. The hacker ethics were chronicled by Steven Levy in ,Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution,[16], and in other texts in which Levy formulates and summarizes general hacker attitudes:
,
,Access to computers-and anything that might teach you something about the way the world works-should be unlimited and total.,
,All information should be free.,
,Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.,
,You can create art and beauty on a computer.,
,Computers can change your life for the better.,
,Hacker ethics are concerned primarily with sharing, openness, collaboration, and engaging in the hands-on imperative.,[16],
,Linus Torvalds,, one of the leaders of the open source movement (known primarily for developing the ,Linux kernel,), has noted in the book ,The Hacker Ethic,[17], that these principles have evolved from the known Protestant ethics and incorporates the spirits of capitalism, as introduced in the early 20th century by ,Max Weber,.
,Hack value is the notion used by hackers to express that something is worth doing or is interesting.,[18], This is something that hackers often feel intuitively about a problem or solution.
,An aspect of hack value is performing feats for the sake of showing that they can be done, even if others think it is difficult. Using things in a unique way outside their intended purpose is often perceived as having hack value. Examples are using a ,dot matrix impact printer, to produce musical notes, using a ,flatbed scanner, to take ultra-high-resolution photographs or using an ,optical mouse, as ,barcode reader,.
,A solution or feat has ""hack value"" if it is done in a way that has finesse, cleverness or brilliance, which makes ,creativity, an essential part of the meaning. For example, ,picking a difficult lock, has hack value; smashing it does not. As another example, proving ,Fermat's last theorem, by linking together most of modern mathematics has hack value; solving a combinatorial problem by ,exhaustively trying all possibilities, does not. Hacking is not using process of elimination to find a solution; it's the process of finding a clever solution to a problem.
,
,Uses,
,While using ,hacker, to refer to someone who enjoys playful cleverness is most often applied to computer programmers, it is sometimes used for people who apply the same attitude to other fields.,[8], For example, ,Richard Stallman, describes the silent composition ,4′33″, by John Cage and the 14th-century ,palindromic, three-part piece ""Ma Fin Est Mon Commencement"" by ,Guillaume de Machaut, as hacks.,[3], According to the Jargon File,,[9], the word ,hacker, was used in a similar sense among radio amateurs in the 1950s, predating the software hacking community.

,The Boston Globe, in 1984 defined ""hackers"" as ""computer nuts"".,[19], In their programmer subculture, a hacker is a person who follows a spirit of playful cleverness and loves programming. It is found in an originally academic movement unrelated to computer security and most visibly associated with ,free software,, ,open source, and ,demoscene,. It also has a ,hacker ethic,, based on the idea that writing software and sharing the result on a voluntary basis is a good idea, and that information should be free, but that it's not up to the hacker to make it free by breaking into private computer systems. This hacker ethic was publicized and perhaps originated in ,Steven Levy,'s ,Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution, (1984). It contains a codification of its principles.
,The programmer subculture of hackers disassociates from the mass media's pejorative use of the word 'hacker' referring to computer security, and usually prefer the term 'cracker' for that meaning. Complaints about supposed mainstream misuse started as early as 1983, when media used ""hacker"" to refer to the computer criminals involved in ,The 414s, case.,[20],
,In the programmer subculture of hackers, a computer hacker is a person who enjoys designing software and building programs with a sense for aesthetics and playful cleverness. The term hack in this sense can be traced back to ""describe the elaborate college pranks that...students would regularly devise"" (Levy, 1984 p. 10). To be considered a 'hack' was an honor among like-minded peers as ""to qualify as a hack, the feat must be imbued with innovation, style and technical virtuosity"" (Levy, 1984 p. 10) The ,MIT, ,Tech Model Railroad Club, Dictionary defined hack in 1959 (not yet in a computer context) as ""1) an article or project without constructive end; 2) a project undertaken on bad self-advice; 3) an entropy booster; 4) to produce, or attempt to produce, a hack(3)"", and ""hacker"" was defined as ""one who hacks, or makes them"". Much of TMRC's jargon was later imported into early computing culture, because the club started using a ,DEC, ,PDP-1, and applied its local model railroad slang in this computing context. Initially incomprehensible to outsiders, the slang also became popular in MIT's computing environments beyond the club. Other examples of jargon imported from the club are 'losing' (""when a piece of equipment is not working""),[16], and 'munged' (""when a piece of equipment is ruined"").,[16],
,Others did not always view hackers with approval. ,MIT living groups, in 1989 avoided advertising their sophisticated ,Project Athena, workstations to prospective members because they wanted residents who were interested in people, not computers, with one fraternity member stating that ""We were worried about the hacker subculture"".,[21],
,According to ,Eric S. Raymond,,,[22], the Open Source and Free Software hacker subculture developed in the 1960s among 'academic hackers',[23], working on early ,minicomputers, in ,computer science, environments in the United States.
,Hackers were influenced by and absorbed many ideas of key technological developments and the people associated with them. Most notable is the technical culture of the pioneers of the ,Arpanet,, starting in 1969. The ,PDP-10, AI machine at MIT, running the ,ITS, operating system and connected to the Arpanet, provided an early hacker meeting point. After 1980 the subculture coalesced with the culture of ,Unix,. Since the mid-1990s, it has been largely coincident with what is now called the ,free software, and ,open source movement,.
,Many programmers have been labeled ""great hackers"",,[24], but the specifics of who that label applies to is a matter of opinion. Certainly major contributors to ,computer science, such as ,Edsger Dijkstra, and ,Donald Knuth,, as well as the inventors of popular software such as ,Linus Torvalds, (,Linux,), and ,Ken Thompson, and ,Dennis Ritchie, (,Unix, and ,C programming language,) are likely to be included in any such list; see also ,List of programmers,. People primarily known for their contributions to the consciousness of the programmer subculture of hackers include ,Richard Stallman,, the founder of the free software movement and the ,GNU project,, president of the ,Free Software Foundation, and author of the famous ,Emacs, text editor as well as the ,GNU Compiler Collection (GCC),, and ,Eric S. Raymond,, one of the founders of the ,Open Source Initiative, and writer of the famous text ,The Cathedral and the Bazaar, and many other essays, maintainer of the ,Jargon File, (which was previously maintained by ,Guy L. Steele, Jr.,).
,Within the computer programmer subculture of hackers, the term hacker is also used for a programmer who reaches a goal by employing a series of modifications to extend existing ,code, or resources. In this sense, it can have a negative connotation of using inelegant ,kludges, to accomplish programming tasks that are quick, but ugly, inelegant, difficult to extend, hard to maintain and inefficient. This derogatory form of the noun "",hack,"" derives from the everyday English sense ""to cut or shape by or as if by crude or ruthless strokes"" [Merriam-Webster] and is even used among users of the positive sense of ""hacker"" who produces ""cool"" or ""neat"" hacks. In other words, to ""hack"" at an original creation, as if with an axe, is to force-fit it into being usable for a task not intended by the original creator, and a ""hacker"" would be someone who does this habitually. (The original creator and the hacker may be the same person.) This usage is common in both programming, engineering and building. In programming, hacking in this sense appears to be tolerated and seen as a necessary compromise in many situations. Some argue that it should not be, due to this negative meaning; others argue that some kludges can, for all their ugliness and imperfection, still have ""hack value"".
,In non-software engineering, the culture is less tolerant of unmaintainable solutions, even when intended to be temporary, and describing someone as a ""hacker"" might imply that they lack professionalism. In this sense, the term has no real positive connotations, except for the idea that the hacker is capable of doing modifications that allow a system to work in the short term, and so has some sort of marketable skills. However, there is always the understanding that a more skillful or technical logician could have produced successful modifications that would not be considered a ""hack-job"". The definition is similar to other, non-computer based uses of the term ""hack-job"". For instance, a professional modification of a production sports car into a racing machine would not be considered a hack-job, but a cobbled together backyard mechanic's result could be. Even though the outcome of a race of the two machines could not be assumed, a quick inspection would instantly reveal the difference in the level of professionalism of the designers. The adjective associated with hacker is ""hackish"" (see the ,Jargon file,).
,In a very universal sense, hacker also means someone who makes things work beyond perceived limits in a clever way in general, without necessarily referring to computers, especially at MIT.,[25], That is, people who apply the creative attitude of software hackers in fields other than computing. This includes even activities that predate computer hacking, for example ,reality hackers, or ,urban spelunkers, (exploring undocumented or unauthorized areas in buildings). One specific example is clever pranks,[26], traditionally perpetrated by MIT students, with the perpetrator being called hacker. For example, when MIT students surreptitiously put a fake police car atop the dome on MIT's Building 10,,[27], that was a hack in this sense, and the students involved were therefore hackers. Other types of hacking are ,reality hackers,, ,wetware, hackers (""hack your brain""), and ,media hackers, (""hack your reputation""). In a similar vein, a ""hack"" may refer to a ,math, hack, that is, a clever solution to a mathematical problem. All of these uses have spread beyond MIT.
,
,Home computing enthusiasts,
,Main article: ,Hacking of consumer electronics,
,In yet another context, a hacker is a computer hobbyist who pushes the limits of software or hardware. The home computer hacking subculture relates to the hobbyist home computing of the late 1970s, beginning with the availability of ,MITS Altair,. An influential organization was the ,Homebrew Computer Club,. However, its roots go back further to ,amateur radio, enthusiasts. The amateur radio slang referred to creatively tinkering to improve performance as ""hacking"" already in the 1950s.,[28],
,A large overlaps between hobbyist hackers and the programmer subculture hackers existed during the Homebrew Club's days, but the interests and values of both communities somewhat diverged. Today, the hobbyists focus on commercial ,computer and video games,, ,software cracking, and exceptional computer programming (,demo scene,). Also of interest to some members of this group is the modification of computer hardware and other electronic devices, see ,modding,.
,
,  ,A ,DIY, musician probes the circuit board of a synthesizer for ,""bends"", using a jeweler's screwdriver and alligator clips,
,Electronics hobbyists working on machines other than computers also fall into this category. This includes people who do simple modifications to ,graphing calculators,, ,video game consoles,, electronic ,musical keyboards, or other device (see ,CueCat, for a notorious example) to expose or add functionality to a device that was unintended for use by end users by the company who created it. A number of ,techno, musicians have modified 1980s-era ,Casio SK-1, sampling keyboards to create unusual sounds by doing ,circuit bending,: connecting wires to different leads of the integrated circuit chips. The results of these DIY experiments range from opening up previously inaccessible features that were part of the chip design to producing the strange, dis-harmonic digital tones that became part of the techno music style.
Companies take different attitudes towards such practices, ranging from open acceptance (such as ,Texas Instruments, for its graphing calculators and ,Lego, for its ,Lego Mindstorms, robotics gear) to outright hostility (such as ,Microsoft,'s attempts to lock out ,Xbox, hackers or the ,DRM, routines on ,Blu-ray Disc, players designed to sabotage compromised players.,[,citation needed,],)
,In this context, a ""hack"" refers to a ,program, that (sometimes illegally) modifies another program, often a video game, giving the user access to features otherwise inaccessible to them. As an example of this use, for ,Palm OS, users (until the 4th iteration of this ,operating system,), a ""hack"" refers to an extension of the operating system which provides additional functionality. Term also refers to those people who cheat on video games using special software. This can also refer to the ,jailbreaking, of ,iPhones,.
,
,Hacker artists,
,See also: ,Fractal art,, ,algorithmic art,, and ,interactive art,
,Hacker artists create ,art, by hacking on ,technology, as an ,artistic medium,. This has extended the definition of the term and what it means to be a hacker. Such ,artists, may work with ,graphics,, ,computer hardware,, ,sculpture,, ,music, and other ,audio,, ,animation,, ,video,, ,software,, ,simulations,, ,mathematics,, reactive ,sensory, systems, text, ,poetry,, ,literature,, or any combination thereof.
,Dartmouth College, musician Larry Polansky states:
,
,Technology and art are inextricably related. Many musicians, video artists, graphic artists, and even poets who work with technology—whether designing it or using it—consider themselves to be part of the 'hacker community.' Computer artists, like non-art hackers, often find themselves on society’s fringes, developing strange, innovative uses of existing technology. There is an empathetic relationship between those, for example, who design experimental music software and hackers who write communications ,freeware,.,[29],
,
,Another description is offered by Jenny Marketou: 
,
,Hacker artists operate as ,culture, hackers who manipulate existing techno-,semiotic, structures towards a different end, to get inside cultural systems on the net and make them do things they were never intended to do.,[30],
,
,A successful software and hardware hacker artist is ,Mark Lottor, (mkl), who has created the 3-D light art projects entitled the ,Cubatron,, and the ,Big Round Cubatron,. This art is made using custom computer technology, with specially designed ,circuit boards, and programming for ,microprocessor, chips to manipulate the ,LED, lights.
,
,Don Hopkins, is a software hacker artist well known for his artistic cellular automata. This art, created by a ,cellular automata, computer program, generates objects which randomly bump into each other and in turn create more objects and designs, similar to a lava lamp, except that the parts change color and form through interaction. Hopkins Says: ,Cellular automata are simple rules that are applied to a grid of cells, or the pixel values of an image. The same rule is applied to every cell, to determine its next state, based on the previous state of that cell and its neighboring cells. There are many interesting cellular automata rules, and they all look very different, with amazing animated dynamic effects. ',Life,' is a widely known cellular automata rule, but many other lesser known rules are much more interesting.
,
,Some hacker artists create art by writing computer code, and others, by developing hardware. Some create with existing software tools such as ,Adobe Photoshop, or ,GIMP,.
,The creative process of hacker artists can be more abstract than artists using non-technological media. For example, ,mathematicians, have produced visually stunning graphic presentations of ,fractals,, which hackers have further enhanced, often producing detailed and intricate graphics and animations from simple mathematical formulas.

,Python, is an ,interpreted,, ,high-level,, ,general-purpose programming language,. Created by ,Guido van Rossum, and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes ,code readability,, notably using ,significant whitespace,. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.,[26], In July 2018, Van Rossum stepped down as the leader in the language community.,[27],[28],
,Python features a ,dynamic type, system and automatic ,memory management,. It supports multiple ,programming paradigms,, including ,object-oriented,, ,imperative,, ,functional, and ,procedural,, and has a large and comprehensive ,standard library,.,[29],
,Python interpreters are available for many ,operating systems,. ,CPython,, the ,reference implementation, of Python, is ,open source, software,[30], and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of Python's other implementations. Python and CPython are managed by the non-profit ,Python Software Foundation,.

,History,[,edit,],
,  ,Guido van Rossum OSCON 2006 cropped,
,Main article: ,History of Python,
,Python was conceived in the late 1980s,[31], by ,Guido van Rossum, at ,Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, (CWI) in the ,Netherlands, as a successor to the ,ABC language, (itself inspired by ,SETL,),[32],, capable of ,exception handling, and interfacing with the ,Amoeba, operating system.,[7], Its implementation began in December 1989.,[33], Van Rossum's long influence on Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community: ,Benevolent Dictator For Life, (BDFL) –  a post from which he gave himself permanent vacation on July 12, 2018.,[34],
,Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 with many major new features, including a ,cycle-detecting, ,garbage collector, and support for ,Unicode,.,[35],
,Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely ,backward-compatible,.,[36], Many of its major features were ,backported, to Python 2.6.x,[37], and 2.7.x version series.  Releases of Python 3 include the ,2to3, utility, which automates (at least partially) the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.,[38],
,Python 2.7's ,end-of-life, date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.,[39],[40], In January 2017, Google announced work on a Python 2.7 to ,Go, ,transcompiler, to improve performance under concurrent workloads.,[41],
,
,Features and philosophy,[,edit,],
,Python is a ,multi-paradigm programming language,. ,Object-oriented programming, and ,structured programming, are fully supported, and many of its features support ,functional programming, and ,aspect-oriented programming, (including by ,metaprogramming,[42], and ,metaobjects, (magic methods)).,[43], Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including ,design by contract,[44],[45], and ,logic programming,.,[46],
,Python uses ,dynamic typing,, and a combination of ,reference counting, and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for ,memory management,. It also features dynamic ,name resolution, (,late binding,), which binds method and variable names during program execution.
,Python's design offers some support for ,functional programming, in the ,Lisp, tradition. It has ,filter(),, ,map(),, and ,reduce(), functions; ,list comprehensions,, ,dictionaries,, and sets; and ,generator, expressions.,[47], The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from ,Haskell, and ,Standard ML,.,[48],
,The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document ,The ,Zen of Python, (,PEP 20,), which includes ,aphorisms, such as:,[49],
,
,Beautiful is better than ugly,
,Explicit is better than implicit,
,Simple is better than complex,
,Complex is better than complicated,
,Readability counts,
,Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly ,extensible,. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ,ABC,, which espoused the opposite approach.,[31],
,While offering choice in coding methodology, the Python philosophy rejects exuberant syntax (such as that of ,Perl,) in favor of a simpler, less-cluttered grammar. As ,Alex Martelli, put it: ""To describe something as 'clever' is ,not, considered a compliment in the Python culture."",[50], Python's philosophy rejects the Perl "",there is more than one way to do it,"" approach to language design in favor of ""there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it"".,[49],
,Python's developers strive to avoid ,premature optimization,, and reject patches to non-critical parts of CPython that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity.,[51], When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or use ,PyPy,, a ,just-in-time compiler,. ,Cython, is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.
,An important goal of Python's developers is keeping it fun to use. This is reflected in the language's name—a tribute to the British comedy group ,Monty Python,[52],—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs (from a ,famous Monty Python sketch,) instead of the standard ,foo and bar,.,[53],[54],
,A common ,neologism, in the Python community is ,pythonic,, which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called ,unpythonic,.
,Users and admirers of Python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as ,Pythonists,, ,Pythonistas,, and ,Pythoneers,.,[55],[56],
,
,Syntax and semantics,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Python syntax and semantics,
,Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use ,curly brackets, to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are optional. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than ,C, or ,Pascal,.,[57],
,
,Indentation,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Python syntax and semantics § Indentation,
,Python uses ,whitespace, indentation, rather than ,curly brackets, or keywords, to delimit ,blocks,. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block.,[58], Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents the program's semantic structure.,[1], This feature is also sometimes termed the ,off-side rule,.
,
,Statements and control flow,[,edit,],
,Python's ,statements, include (among others):
,
,The assignment statement (token '=', the equals sign). This operates differently than in traditional ,imperative programming, languages, and this fundamental mechanism (including the nature of Python's version of ,variables,) illuminates many other features of the language. Assignment in ,C,, e.g., ,x = 2,, translates to ""typed variable name x receives a copy of numeric value 2"". The (right-hand) value is copied into an ,allocated storage location, for which the (left-hand) ,variable name, is the symbolic address. The memory allocated to the variable is large enough (potentially quite large) for the declared ,type,. In the simplest case of Python assignment, using the same example, ,x = 2,, translates to ""(generic) name x receives a ,reference, to a separate, dynamically allocated ,object, of numeric (int) type of value 2."" This is termed ,binding, the name to the object. Since the name's storage location doesn't ,contain, the indicated value, it is improper to call it a ,variable,. Names may be subsequently rebound at any time to objects of greatly varying types, including strings, procedures, complex objects with data and methods, etc. Successive assignments of a common value to multiple names, e.g., ,x = 2,; ,y = 2,; ,z = 2, result in allocating storage to (at most) three names and one numeric object, to which all three names are bound. Since a name is a generic reference holder it is unreasonable to associate a fixed ,data type, with it. However at a given time a name will be bound to ,some, object, which ,will, have a type; thus there is ,dynamic typing,.,
,The ,if, statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with ,else, and ,elif, (a contraction of else-if).,
,The ,for, statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block.,
,The ,while, statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true.,
,The ,try, statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by ,except, clauses; it also ensures that clean-up code in a ,finally, block will always be run regardless of how the block exits.,
,The ,raise, statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception.,
,The ,class, statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a ,class,, for use in ,object-oriented programming,.,
,The ,def, statement, which defines a ,function, or ,method,.,
,The ,with, statement, from Python 2.5 released on September 2006,,[59], which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a ,lock, before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a ,file, and then closing it), allowing ,Resource Acquisition Is Initialization, (RAII)-like behavior and replaces a common try/finally idiom.,[60],
,The ,pass, statement, which serves as a ,NOP,. It is syntactically needed to create an empty code block.,
,The ,assert, statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that ought to apply.,
,The ,yield, statement, which returns a value from a ,generator, function. From Python 2.5, ,yield, is also an operator. This form is used to implement ,coroutines,.,
,The ,import, statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program. There are three ways of using import: ,import <module name> [as <alias>], or ,from <module name> import *, or ,from <module name> import <definition 1> [as <alias 1>], <definition 2> [as <alias 2>], ...,.,
,The ,print, statement was changed to the ,print(), function in Python 3.,[61],
,
Python does not support ,tail call, optimization or ,first-class continuations,, and, according to Guido van Rossum, it never will.,[62],[63], However, better support for ,coroutine,-like functionality is provided in 2.5, by extending Python's ,generators,.,[64], Before 2.5, generators were ,lazy, ,iterators,; information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5, it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and from Python 3.3, the information can be passed through multiple stack levels.,[65],
,
,Expressions,[,edit,],
,Some Python ,expressions, are similar to languages such as ,C, and ,Java,, while some are not:
,
,Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of divisions in Python. They are floor division and integer division.,[66], Python also added the ,**, operator for exponentiation.,
,From Python 3.5, the new ,@, infix operator was introduced. It is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for ,matrix multiplication,.,[67],[68],
,In Python, ,==, compares by value, versus Java, which compares numerics by value,[69], and objects by reference.,[70], (Value comparisons in Java on objects can be performed with the ,equals(), method.) Python's ,is, operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference). In Python, comparisons may be chained, for example ,a <= b <= c,.,
,Python uses the words ,and,, ,or,, ,not, for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic ,&&,, ,||,, ,!, used in Java and C.,
,Python has a type of expression termed a ,list comprehension,. Python 2.4 extended list comprehensions into a more general expression termed a ,generator, expression,.,[47],
,Anonymous functions, are implemented using ,lambda expressions,; however, these are limited in that the body can only be one expression.,
,Conditional expressions in Python are written as ,x if c else y,[71], (different in order of operands from the ,c ? x : y, operator common to many other languages).,
,Python makes a distinction between ,lists, and ,tuples,. Lists are written as ,[1, 2, 3],, are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must be ,immutable, in Python). Tuples are written as ,(1, 2, 3),, are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. The ,+, operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples. Thus, given the variable ,t, initially equal to ,(1, 2, 3),, executing ,t = t + (4, 5), first evaluates ,t + (4, 5),, which yields ,(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),, which is then assigned back to ,t,, thereby effectively ""modifying the contents"" of ,t,, while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.,[72],
,Python features ,sequence unpacking, where multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to (a variable, a writable property, etc.), are associated in the identical manner to that forming tuple literals and, as a whole, are put on the left hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. The statement expects an ,iterable, object on the right hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through, and will iterate through it, assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left.,[73],
,Python has a ""string format"" operator ,%,. This functions analogous to ,printf, format strings in ,C,, e.g. ,""spam=%s eggs=%d"" % (""blah"", 2), evaluates to ,""spam=blah eggs=2"",. In Python 3 and 2.6+, this was supplemented by the ,format(), method of the ,str, class, e.g. ,""spam={0} eggs={1}"".format(""blah"", 2),. Python 3.6 added ""f-strings"": ,blah = ""blah""; eggs = 2; f'spam={blah} eggs={eggs}',.,[74],
,Python has various kinds of ,string literals,:
,Strings delimited by single or double quote marks. Unlike in ,Unix shells,, ,Perl, and Perl-influenced languages, single quote marks and double quote marks function identically. Both kinds of string use the backslash (,\,) as an ,escape character,. ,String interpolation, became available in Python 3.6 as ""formatted string literals"".,[74],
,Triple-quoted strings, which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks. They may span multiple lines and function like ,here documents, in shells, Perl and ,Ruby,.,
,Raw string, varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with an ,r,. Escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as ,regular expressions, and ,Windows,-style paths. Compare "",@,-quoting"" in ,C#,.,
,Python has ,array index, and ,array slicing, expressions on lists, denoted as ,a[key],, ,a[start:stop], or ,a[start:stop:step],. Indexes are ,zero-based,, and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the ,start, index up to, but not including, the ,stop, index. The third slice parameter, called ,step, or ,stride,, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted, for example ,a[:], returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a ,shallow copy,.,
,In Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as ,Common Lisp,, ,Scheme,, or ,Ruby,. This leads to duplicating some functionality. For example:
,
,List comprehensions, vs. ,for,-loops,
,Conditional, expressions vs. ,if, blocks,
,The ,eval(), vs. ,exec(), built-in functions (in Python 2, ,exec, is a statement); the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements.,
,Statements cannot be a part of an expression, so list and other comprehensions or ,lambda expressions,, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. A particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as ,a = 1, cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C error of mistaking an assignment operator ,=, for an equality operator ,==, in conditions: ,if (c = 1) { ... }, is syntactically valid (but probably unintended) C code but ,if c = 1: ..., causes a syntax error in Python.
,
,Methods,[,edit,],
,Methods, on objects are ,functions, attached to the object's class; the syntax ,instance.method(argument), is, for normal methods and functions, ,syntactic sugar, for ,Class.method(instance, argument),. Python methods have an explicit ,self, parameter to access ,instance data,, in contrast to the implicit ,self, (or ,this,) in some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g., ,C++,, ,Java,, ,Objective-C,, or ,Ruby,).,[75],
,
,Typing,[,edit,],
,  ,
,Python uses ,duck typing, and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at ,compile time,; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type. Despite being ,dynamically typed,, Python is ,strongly typed,, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them.
,Python allows programmers to define their own types using ,classes,, which are most often used for ,object-oriented programming,. New ,instances, of classes are constructed by calling the class (for example, ,SpamClass(), or ,EggsClass(),), and the classes are instances of the ,metaclass, ,type, (itself an instance of itself), allowing ,metaprogramming, and ,reflection,.
,Before version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes: ,old-style, and ,new-style,.,[76], The syntax of both styles is the same, the difference being whether the class ,object, is inherited from, directly or indirectly (all new-style classes inherit from ,object, and are instances of ,type,). In versions of Python 2 from Python 2.2 onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. Old-style classes were eliminated in Python 3.0.
,The long term plan is to support ,gradual typing,[77], and from Python 3.5, the syntax of the language allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation, CPython. An experimental optional static type checker named ,mypy, supports compile-time type checking.,[78],

,Mathematics,[,edit,],
,Python has the usual C language arithmetic operators (,+,, ,-,, ,*,, ,/,, ,%,). It also has ,**, for exponentiation, e.g. ,5**3 == 125, and ,9**0.5 == 3.0,, and a new matrix multiply ,@, operator is included in version 3.5.,[80], Additionally, it has a unary operator (,~,), which essentially inverts all the bits of its one argument. For integers, this means ,~x=-x-1,.,[81], Other operators include bitwise shift operators ,x << y,, which shifts ,x, to the left ,y, places, the same as ,x*(2**y) ,, and ,x >> y,, which shifts ,x, to the right ,y, places, the same as ,x//(2**y) ,.,[82],
,The behavior of division has changed significantly over time:,[83],[,why?,],
,
,Python 2.1 and earlier use the C division behavior. The ,/, operator is integer division if both operands are integers, and floating-point division otherwise. Integer division rounds towards 0, e.g. ,7/3 == 2, and ,-7/3 == -2,.,
,Python 2.2 changes integer division to round towards negative infinity, e.g. ,7/3 == 2, and ,-7/3 == -3,. The floor division ,//, operator is introduced. So ,7//3 == 2,, ,-7//3 == -3,, ,7.5//3 == 2.0, and ,-7.5//3 == -3.0,. Adding ,from __future__ import division, causes a module to use Python 3.0 rules for division (see next).,
,Python 3.0 changes ,/, to be always floating-point division. In Python terms, the pre-3.0 ,/, is ,classic division,, the version-3.0 ,/, is ,real division,, and ,//, is ,floor division,.,
,Rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. For instance, it means that the equation ,(a + b)//b == a//b + 1, is always true. It also means that the equation ,b*(a//b) + a%b == a, is valid for both positive and negative values of ,a,. However, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of ,a%b, is, as expected, in the ,half-open interval, [0, ,b,), where ,b, is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval (,b,, 0] when ,b, is negative.,[84],
,Python provides a ,round, function for ,rounding, a float to the nearest integer. For ,tie-breaking,, versions before 3 use round-away-from-zero: ,round(0.5), is 1.0, ,round(-0.5), is −1.0.,[85], Python 3 uses ,round to even,: ,round(1.5), is 2, ,round(2.5), is 2.,[86],
,Python allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression ,a < b < c, tests whether ,a, is less than ,b, and ,b, is less than ,c,.,[87],  C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate ,a < b,, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with ,c,.,[88],
,Python has extensive built-in support for ,arbitrary precision arithmetic,. Integers are transparently switched from the machine-supported maximum fixed-precision (usually 32 or 64 bits), belonging to the python type ,int,, to arbitrary precision, belonging to the Python type ,long,, where needed. The latter have an ""L"" suffix in their textual representation.,[89], (In Python 3, the distinction between the ,int, and ,long, types was eliminated; this behavior is now entirely contained by the ,int, class.) The ,Decimal, type/class in module ,decimal, (since version 2.4) provides decimal floating point numbers to arbitrary precision and several rounding modes.,[90], The ,Fraction, type in module ,fractions, (since version 2.6) provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers.,[91],
,Due to Python's extensive mathematics library, and the third-party library ,NumPy, that further extends the native capabilities, it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation.,[,citation needed,],
,
,Libraries,[,edit,],
,Python's large ,standard library,, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths,,[92], provides tools suited to many tasks. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as ,MIME, and ,HTTP, are supported. It includes modules for creating ,graphical user interfaces,, connecting to ,relational databases,, ,generating pseudorandom numbers,, arithmetic with arbitrary precision decimals,,[93], manipulating ,regular expressions,, and ,unit testing,.
,Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications (for example, the ,Web Server Gateway Interface, (WSGI) implementation ,wsgiref, follows PEP 333,[94],), but most modules are not. They are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites (if supplied). However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations.
,As of  March 2018,,[update], the ,Python Package Index, (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software, contains over 130,000,[95], packages with a wide range of functionality, including:
,
,Graphical user interfaces,
,Web frameworks,
,Multimedia,
,Databases,
,Networking,
,Test frameworks,
,Automation,
,Web scraping,[96],
,Documentation,
,System administration,
,Scientific computing,
,Text processing,
,Image processing,
,Development environments,[,edit,],
,See also: ,Comparison of integrated development environments § Python,
,Most Python implementations (including CPython) include a ,read–eval–print loop, (REPL), permitting them to function as a ,command line interpreter, for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives results immediately.
,Other shells, including ,IDLE, and ,IPython,, add further abilities such as auto-completion, session state retention and ,syntax highlighting,.
,As well as standard desktop ,integrated development environments,, there are ,Web browser,-based IDEs; ,SageMath, (intended for developing science and math-related Python programs); ,PythonAnywhere,, a browser-based IDE and hosting environment; and Canopy IDE, a commercial Python IDE emphasizing scientific computing.,[97],
,
,Implementations,[,edit,],
,See also: ,List of Python software § Python implementations,
,Reference implementation,[,edit,],
,CPython, is the ,reference implementation, of Python. It is written in ,C,, meeting the ,C89, standard with several select ,C99, features.,[98], It compiles Python programs into an intermediate ,bytecode,[99], which is then executed by its ,virtual machine,.,[100], CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of C and native Python. It is available for many platforms, including ,Windows, and most modern ,Unix-like, systems. Platform portability was one of its earliest priorities.,[101],
,
,Other implementations,[,edit,],
,PyPy, is a fast, compliant,[102], interpreter of Python 2.7 and 3.5. Its ,just-in-time compiler, brings a significant speed improvement over CPython.,[103],
,Stackless Python, is a significant fork of CPython that implements ,microthreads,; it does not use the C memory stack, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. PyPy also has a stackless version.,[104],
,MicroPython, and ,CircuitPython, are Python 3 variants optimised for ,microcontrollers,.
,
,Unsupported implementations,[,edit,],
,Other just-in-time Python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported:
,
,Google began a project named ,Unladen Swallow, in 2009 with the aim of speeding up the Python interpreter fivefold by using the ,LLVM,, and of improving its multithreading ability to scale to thousands of cores.,[105],
,Psyco, is a ,just-in-time, ,specialising, compiler that integrates with CPython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. The emitted code is specialised for certain ,data types, and is faster than standard Python code.,
,In 2005, ,Nokia, released a Python interpreter for the ,Series 60, mobile phones named ,PyS60,. It includes many of the modules from the CPython implementations and some additional modules to integrate with the ,Symbian, operating system. The project has been kept up-to-date to run on all variants of the S60 platform, and several third-party modules are available. The Nokia ,N900, also supports Python with ,GTK, widget libraries, enabling programs to be written and run on the target device.,[106],
,
,Cross-compilers to other languages,[,edit,],
,There are several compilers to high-level ,object languages,, with either unrestricted Python, a restricted subset of Python, or a language similar to Python as the source language:
,
,Jython, compiles into Java byte code, which can then be executed by every ,Java virtual machine, implementation. This also enables the use of Java class library functions from the Python program.,
,IronPython, follows a similar approach in order to run Python programs on the .NET ,Common Language Runtime,.,
,The ,RPython, language can be compiled to ,C,, ,Java bytecode,, or ,Common Intermediate Language,, and is used to build the PyPy interpreter of Python.,
,Pyjs, compiles Python to ,JavaScript,.,
,Cython, compiles Python to ,C, and ,C++,.,
,Pythran compiles Python to ,C++,.,
,Somewhat dated ,Pyrex, (latest release in 2010) and ,Shed Skin, (latest release in 2013) compile to C and C++ respectively.,
,Google's Grumpy compiles Python to ,Go,.,
,MyHDL, compiles Python to ,VHDL,.,
,Nuitka, compiles Python into C++.,[107],
,Performance,[,edit,],
,A performance comparison of various Python implementations on a non-numerical (combinatorial) workload was presented at EuroSciPy '13.,[108],
,
,Development,[,edit,],
,Python's development is conducted largely through the ,Python Enhancement Proposal, (PEP) process, the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues and documenting Python design decisions.,[109], Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented on by the Python community and Guido Van Rossum, Python's ,Benevolent Dictator For Life,.,[109],
,Enhancement of the language corresponds with development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for the language's development. Specific issues are discussed in the ,Roundup, ,bug tracker, maintained at python.org.,[110], Development originally took place on a ,self-hosted, source-code repository running ,Mercurial,, until Python moved to ,GitHub, in January 2017.,[111],
,CPython's public releases come in three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented:
,
,Backward-incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and need to be manually ,ported,. The first part of the version number is incremented. These releases happen infrequently—for example, version 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0.,
,Major or ""feature"" releases, about every 18 months, are largely compatible but introduce new features. The second part of the version number is incremented. Each major version is supported by bugfixes for several years after its release.,[112],
,Bugfix releases, which introduce no new features, occur about every 3 months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. The third and final part of the version number is incremented.,[113],
,Many ,alpha, beta, and release-candidates, are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. Although there is a rough schedule for each release, they are often delayed if the code is not ready. Python's development team monitors the state of the code by running the large ,unit test, suite during development, and using the ,BuildBot, ,continuous integration, system.,[114],
,The community of Python developers has also contributed over 86,000,[115], software modules (as of  20 August 2016,[update],) to the ,Python Package Index, (PyPI), the official repository of third-party Python libraries.
,The major ,academic conference, on Python is ,PyCon,. There are also special Python mentoring programmes, such as ,Pyladies,.
,
,Naming,[,edit,],
,Python's name is derived from the British comedy group ,Monty Python,, whom Python creator Guido van Rossum enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references appear frequently in Python code and culture;,[116], for example, the ,metasyntactic variables, often used in Python literature are ,spam, and ,eggs, instead of the traditional ,foo, and ,bar,.,[116],[117], The official Python documentation also contains various references to Monty Python routines.,[118],[119],
,The prefix ,Py-, is used to show that something is related to Python. Examples of the use of this prefix in names of Python applications or libraries include ,Pygame,, a ,binding, of ,SDL, to Python (commonly used to create games); ,PyQt, and ,PyGTK,, which bind ,Qt, and ,GTK, to Python respectively; and ,PyPy,, a Python implementation originally written in Python.
,
,API documentation generators,[,edit,],
,Python API documentation generators include:
,
,Sphinx,
,Epydoc,
,HeaderDoc,
,pydoc,
,Uses,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,List of Python software,
,Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the ,TIOBE Programming Community Index, where, as of  January 2018,[update],, it is the fourth most popular language (behind ,Java,, ,C,, and ,C++,).,[120], It was selected Programming Language of the Year in 2007 and 2010.,[121],
,An empirical study found that scripting languages, such as Python, are more productive than conventional languages, such as C and Java, for programming problems involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary, and determined that memory consumption was often ""better than Java and not much worse than C or C++"".,[122],
,Large organizations that use Python include ,Wikipedia,, ,Google,,,[123], ,Yahoo!,,,[124], ,CERN,,,[125], ,NASA,,,[126], ,Facebook,,,[127], ,Amazon,, ,Instagram,, ,Spotify,[128], and some smaller entities like ,ILM,[129], and ,ITA,.,[130], The social news networking site ,Reddit, is written entirely in Python.
,Python can serve as a ,scripting language, for ,web applications,, e.g., via ,mod_wsgi, for the ,Apache web server,.,[131], With ,Web Server Gateway Interface,, a standard API has evolved to facilitate these applications. ,Web frameworks, like ,Django,, ,Pylons,, ,Pyramid,, ,TurboGears,, ,web2py,, ,Tornado,, ,Flask,, ,Bottle, and ,Zope, support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications. ,Pyjs, and ,IronPython, can be used to develop the client-side of Ajax-based applications. ,SQLAlchemy, can be used as ,data mapper, to a relational database. ,Twisted, is a framework to program communications between computers, and is used (for example) by ,Dropbox,.
,Libraries such as ,NumPy,, ,SciPy, and ,Matplotlib, allow the effective use of Python in scientific computing,,[132],[133], with specialized libraries such as ,Biopython, and ,Astropy, providing domain-specific functionality. ,SageMath, is a ,mathematical software, with a ,notebook interface, programmable in Python: its library covers many aspects of ,mathematics,, including ,algebra,, ,combinatorics,, ,numerical mathematics,, ,number theory,, and ,calculus,.
,Python has been successfully embedded in many software products as a scripting language, including in ,finite element method, software such as ,Abaqus,, 3D parametric modeler like ,FreeCAD,, 3D animation packages such as ,3ds Max,, ,Blender,, ,Cinema 4D,, ,Lightwave,, ,Houdini,, ,Maya,, ,modo,, ,MotionBuilder,, ,Softimage,, the visual effects compositor ,Nuke,, 2D imaging programs like ,GIMP,,,[134], ,Inkscape,, ,Scribus, and ,Paint Shop Pro,,,[135], and ,musical notation, programs like ,scorewriter, and ,capella,. ,GNU Debugger, uses Python as a ,pretty printer, to show complex structures such as C++ containers. ,Esri, promotes Python as the best choice for writing scripts in ,ArcGIS,.,[136], It has also been used in several video games,,[137],[138], and has been adopted as first of the three available ,programming languages, in ,Google App Engine,, the other two being ,Java, and ,Go,.,[139], Python is also used in ,algorithmic trading, and quantitative finance.,[140], Python can also be implemented in APIs of online brokerages that run on other languages by using wrappers.,[141],
,Python is commonly used in ,artificial intelligence, projects with the help of libraries like ,TensorFlow,, ,Keras, and ,Scikit-learn,.,[142],[143],[144],[145], As a scripting language with ,modular architecture,, simple syntax and rich text processing tools, Python is often used for ,natural language processing,.,[146],
,Many operating systems include Python as a standard component. It ships with most ,Linux distributions,, ,AmigaOS 4,, ,FreeBSD,, ,NetBSD,, ,OpenBSD, and ,macOS,, and can be used from the command line (terminal). Many Linux distributions use installers written in Python: ,Ubuntu, uses the ,Ubiquity, installer, while ,Red Hat Linux, and ,Fedora, use the ,Anaconda, installer. ,Gentoo Linux, uses Python in its ,package management system,, ,Portage,.
,Python is used extensively in the ,information security, industry, including in exploit development.,[147],[148],
,Most of the ,Sugar, software for the ,One Laptop per Child, XO, now developed at ,Sugar Labs,, is written in Python.,[149], The ,Raspberry Pi, ,single-board computer, project has adopted Python as its main user-programming language.
,LibreOffice, includes Python, and intends to replace Java with Python. Its Python Scripting Provider is a core feature,[150], since Version 4.0 from 7 February 2013.
,
,Languages influenced by Python,[,edit,],
,Python's design and philosophy have influenced many other programming languages:
,
,Boo, uses indentation, a similar syntax, and a similar object model.,[151],
,Cobra, uses indentation and a similar syntax, and its ""Acknowledgements"" document lists Python first among languages that influenced it.,[152], However, Cobra directly supports ,design-by-contract,, ,unit tests,, and optional ,static typing,.,[153],
,CoffeeScript,, a programming language that cross-compiles to JavaScript, has Python-inspired syntax.,
,ECMAScript, borrowed ,iterators, and ,generators, from Python.,[154],
,Go, is designed for the ""speed of working in a dynamic language like Python"",[155], and shares the same syntax for slicing arrays.,
,Groovy, was motivated by the desire to bring the Python design philosophy to ,Java,.,[156],
,Julia, was designed ""with ,true macros, [.. and to be] as usable for general programming as Python [and] should be as fast as C"".,[22], Calling to or from Julia is possible; to with PyCall.jl and a Python package pyjulia allows calling, in the other direction, from Python.,
,Kotlin, is a functional programming language with an interactive shell similar to Python. However, Kotlin is strongly typed with access to standard Java libraries.,[157],
,Ruby,'s creator, ,Yukihiro Matsumoto,, has said: ""I wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than Perl, and more object-oriented than Python. That's why I decided to design my own language."",[158],
,Swift,, a programming language developed by Apple, has some Python-inspired syntax.,[159],
,GDScript,, dynamically typed programming language used to create video-games. It is extremely similar to Python with a few minor differences.,
,Python's development practices have also been emulated by other languages. For example, the practice of requiring a document describing the rationale for, and issues surrounding, a change to the language (in Python, a PEP) is also used in ,Tcl,[160], and ,Erlang,.,[161],
,Python received TIOBE's Programming Language of the Year awards in 2007 and 2010. The award is given to the language with the greatest growth in popularity over the year, as measured by the ,TIOBE index,.,[162],

,Ethereum, is an ,open-source,, ,public,, ,blockchain,-based ,distributed computing, platform and ,operating system, featuring ,smart contract, (scripting) functionality. It supports a modified version of ,Nakamoto, consensus via transaction-based state transitions.
,Ether, is a ,cryptocurrency, whose blockchain is generated by the Ethereum platform. ,Ether, can be transferred between accounts and used to compensate participant mining nodes for computations performed.,[3], Ethereum provides a decentralized ,virtual machine,, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which can execute scripts using an international network of public nodes. The virtual machine's ,instruction set,, in contrast to others like ,Bitcoin, ,Script,, is ,expressive, enough as languages like ,C, that it's said to be ,Turing-complete, in an informal sense. ""Gas"", an internal transaction pricing mechanism, is used to mitigate ,spam, and allocate resources on the network.
,Ethereum was proposed in late 2013 by ,Vitalik Buterin,, a cryptocurrency researcher and programmer. Development was funded by an online ,crowdsale, that took place between July and August 2014.
,The system went live on 30 July 2015, with 72 million coins ""premined"". 
This accounts for about 70 percent of the total circulating supply in 2018.
,In 2016, as a result of the exploitation of a flaw in ,The DAO, project's ,smart contract, software, and subsequent theft of $50 million worth of Ether,,[4], Ethereum was split into two separate blockchains – the new separate version became Ethereum (ETH) with the theft reversed,,[5], and the original continued as ,Ethereum Classic, (ETC).,[6],[7],
,The value of the Ethereum currency grew over 13,000 percent in 2017, to over $1400.,[8], By September 2018, it had fallen back to $200.,[9],

,Etymology,
,Vitalik Buterin picked the name Ethereum after browsing Wikipedia articles about elements and science fiction, when he found the name, noting, ""I immediately realized that I liked it better than all of the other alternatives that I had seen; I suppose it was the fact that sounded nice and it had the word ',ether,', referring to the hypothetical invisible medium that permeates the universe and allows light to travel.""
,
,History,
,Ethereum was initially described in a white paper by ,Vitalik Buterin,,,[10], a programmer involved with ,Bitcoin Magazine,, in late 2013 with a goal of building decentralized applications.,[11],[12], Buterin had argued that Bitcoin needed a ,scripting language, for application development. Failing to gain agreement, he proposed development of a new platform with a more general scripting language.,[13],:,88,
,At the time of public announcement in January 2014, the core Ethereum team was Vitalik Buterin, Mihai Alisie, Anthony Di Iorio, and Charles Hoskinson. Formal development of the Ethereum software project began in early 2014 through a ,Swiss, company, ,Ethereum Switzerland GmbH, (,EthSuisse,).,[14],[15], Subsequently, a Swiss non-profit foundation, the Ethereum Foundation (,Stiftung Ethereum,), was created as well. Development was funded by an online public ,crowdsale, during July–August 2014, with the participants buying the Ethereum value token (ether) with another digital currency, ,bitcoin,.
,While there was early praise for the technical innovations of Ethereum, questions were also raised about its security and scalability.,[11],
,
,Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA),
,In March 2017, various blockchain start-ups, research groups, and Fortune 500 companies announced the creation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) with 30 founding members.,[16], By May, the nonprofit organization had 116 enterprise members—including ,ConsenSys,, ,CME Group,, ,Cornell University's research group,, ,Toyota Research Institute,, ,Samsung SDS,, ,Microsoft,, ,Intel,, ,J. P. Morgan,, ,Cooley LLP,, ,Merck KGaA,, ,DTCC,, ,Deloitte,, ,Accenture,, ,Banco Santander,, ,BNY Mellon,, ,ING,, and ,National Bank of Canada,.,[17],[18],[19], By July 2017, there were over 150 members in the alliance, including recent additions ,MasterCard,, ,Cisco Systems,, ,Sberbank, and ,Scotiabank,.,[20],[21],

,Several codenamed prototypes of the Ethereum platform were developed by the Foundation, as part of their Proof-of-Concept series, prior to the official launch of the Frontier network. ""Olympic"" was the last of these prototypes, and public beta pre-release.
,The Olympic network provided users with a ,bug bounty, of 25,000 ether for stress testing the limits of the Ethereum blockchain. ""Frontier"" marked the tentative experimental release of the Ethereum platform in July 2015.,[22],
,Since the initial launch, Ethereum has undergone several planned protocol upgrades, which are important changes affecting the underlying functionality and/or ,incentive structures, of the platform.
,[23],[24],
,
,Protocol upgrades are accomplished by means of a ,soft fork, of the open source code base.
,
,""Homestead"" was the first to be considered ,stable,.
,It included improvements to transaction processing, gas pricing, and security
and the soft fork occurred on 31 July 2015.,[13],:,87,
,The ""Metropolis Part 1: Byzantium"" soft fork took effect on 16 October 2017, and included changes to reduce the complexity of the EVM and provide more flexibility for smart contract developers.,[24], Byzantium also adds supports for zk-SNARKs (from ,Zcash,); with the first zk-SNARK transaction occurring on testnet on September 19, 2017.
,
,The DAO event,
,Main article: ,The DAO (organization),
,In 2016 a ,decentralized autonomous organization, called ,The DAO,, a set of ,smart contracts, developed on the platform, raised a record ,US$150 million, in a ,crowdsale, to fund the project.,[25], The DAO was exploited in June when ,US$50 million, in Ether were taken by an unknown hacker.,[26],[27], The event sparked a debate in the crypto-community about whether Ethereum should perform a contentious ""hard fork"" to reappropriate the affected funds.,[28], As a result of the dispute, the network split in two. Ethereum (the subject of this article) continued on the forked blockchain, while ,Ethereum Classic, continued on the original blockchain. The hard fork created a rivalry between the two networks.
,After the hard fork related to The DAO, Ethereum subsequently forked twice in the fourth quarter of 2016 to deal with other attacks. By the end of November 2016, Ethereum had increased its ,DDoS, protection, de-bloated the blockchain, and thwarted further spam attacks by hackers.

,Ether, is a fundamental ,cryptocurrency, for operation of Ethereum, which thereby provides a public ,distributed ledger, for transactions. It is used to pay for gas, a unit of computation used in transactions and other state transitions. Mistakenly, this currency is also referred to as ,Ethereum,.
,It is listed under the code ETH and traded on ,cryptocurrency, exchanges, and the ,Greek, ,uppercase Xi, character (Ξ) is generally used for its ,currency symbol,. It is also used to pay for transaction fees and computational services on the Ethereum network.,[29],
,
,Characteristics,
,Further information: ,Cryptocurrency,
,As with other cryptocurrencies, the validity of each ether is provided by a ,blockchain,, which is a continuously growing list of ,records,, called ,blocks,, which are linked and secured using ,cryptography,.,[30],[31], By design, the blockchain is inherently resistant to modification of the data. It is an open, ,distributed ledger, that records transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way.,[32], Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum operates using accounts and balances in a manner called state transitions. This does not rely upon ,unspent transaction outputs, (UTXOs). State denotes the current balances of all accounts and extra data. State is not stored on the blockchain, it is stored in a separate ,Merkle, Patricia tree. A ,cryptocurrency wallet, stores the ,public and private ""keys"", or ""addresses"" which can be used to receive or spend Ether. These can be generated through BIP 39 style mnemonics for a BIP 32 ""HD Wallet"". In Ethereum, this is unnecessary as it does not operate in a UTXO scheme. With the private key, it is possible to write in the blockchain, effectively making an ether transaction.
,To send ether to an account, you need the public key of that account. Ether accounts are pseudonymous in that they are not linked to individual persons, but rather to one or more specific addresses.
,Owners can store these addresses in software, on paper and possibly in memory (""brain wallet"").
,
,Addresses,
,Ethereum addresses are composed of the prefix ""0x"", a common identifier for ,hexadecimal,, concatenated with the rightmost 20 bytes of the ,Keccak-256, hash (,big endian,) of the ,ECDSA, ,public key,. In hexadecimal, 2 digits represents a byte, meaning addresses contain 40 hexadecimal digits. One example is 0xb794F5eA0ba39494cE839613fffBA74279579268, the Poloniex ColdWallet. Contract addresses are in the same format, however they are determined by sender and creation transaction nonce.,[33], User accounts are indistinguishable from contract accounts given only an address for each and no blockchain data. Any valid Keccak-256 hash put into the described format is valid, even if it does not correspond to an account with a private key or a contract. This is unlike Bitcoin, which uses ,base58check, to ensure that addresses are properly typed.
,
,Comparison to bitcoin,
,Ether is different from ,Bitcoin, (the ,cryptocurrency, with the largest ,market capitalization, as of June 2018) in several aspects:
,
,Its ,block time, is 14 to 15 seconds, compared with 10 minutes for bitcoin.,
,Mining, of ether generates new coins at a usually consistent rate, occasionally changing during hard forks, while for bitcoin the rate halves every 4 years.,
,For proof-of-work, it uses the ,Ethash, algorithm which reduces the advantage of specialized ,ASICs, in mining.,
,Transaction fees differ by computational complexity, bandwidth use and storage needs (in a system known as gas), while bitcoin transactions compete by means of transaction size, in bytes.,
,Ethereum gas units each have a price that can be specified in a transaction. This is typically measured in Gwei. Bitcoin transactions usually have fees specified in satoshis per byte.,
,Transaction fees are generally considerably lower for ether than for Bitcoin. In December 2017, the median transaction fee for ether corresponded to $0.33, while for bitcoin it corresponded to $23.,
,Ethereum uses an account system where values in Wei are debited from accounts and credited to another, as opposed to Bitcoin's UTXO system, which is more analogous to spending cash and receiving change in return.,
,Supply,
,The total supply of ether was Ξ100 million as of June 2018. In 2017, mining generated 9.2 million new ether, corresponding to a 10% increase in its total supply. Casper FFG and CBC are expected to reduce the inflation rate to between 0.5% to 2%. There is no currently implemented hard cap on the total supply of ETH.
,
,Markets and stores,
,Ether can be traded by regular currency ,brokers,, ,cryptocurrency exchanges,, as well as many online ,cryptocurrency wallets,.,[34],
,
,Platform,
,Virtual Machine,
,The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum. It is a 256-bit register stack, designed to run the same code exactly as intended. It is the fundamental consensus mechanism for Ethereum. The formal definition of the EVM is specified in the Ethereum Yellow Paper.,[33],[35], On February 1, 2018, there were 27,500 nodes in the main Ethereum network.,[36], Ethereum Virtual Machines have been implemented in ,C++,, ,Go,, ,Haskell,, ,Java,, ,JavaScript,, ,Python,, ,Ruby,, ,Rust,, and ,WebAssembly, (currently under development).
,
,Smart contracts,
,Ethereum's ,smart contracts, are based on different computer languages, which developers use to program their own functionalities. Smart contracts are ,high-level, programming ,abstractions, that are compiled down to EVM ,bytecode, and deployed to the Ethereum blockchain for execution. They can be written in ,Solidity, (a language library with similarities to ,C, and ,JavaScript,), Serpent (similar to ,Python,, but deprecated), LLL (a ,low-level, ,Lisp,-like language), and Mutan (,Go,-based, but deprecated). There is also a research-oriented language under development called Viper (a ,strongly-typed, ,Python,-derived ,decidable language,).
,Smart contracts can be public, which opens up the possibility to prove functionality, e.g. self-contained ,provably fair, casinos.,[37],
,One issue related to using smart contracts on a public blockchain is that bugs, including security holes, are visible to all but cannot be fixed quickly.,[38], One example of this is the 17 June 2016 attack on The DAO, which could not be quickly stopped or reversed.,[26],
,There is ongoing research on how to use formal verification to express and prove non-trivial properties. A ,Microsoft Research, report noted that writing solid smart contracts can be extremely difficult in practice, using The DAO hack to illustrate this problem. The report discussed tools that Microsoft had developed for verifying contracts, and noted that a large-scale analysis of published contracts is likely to uncover widespread vulnerabilities. The report also stated that it is possible to verify the equivalence of a Solidity program and the EVM code.,[39],
,
,Applications,
,Ethereum is written in Turing complete language, which includes seven different programming languages.,[40], Developers use the language to create and publish applications which they know will run inside Ethereum.,[41],[42], It's a cumbersome system, but that's not deterring developers from writing Ethereum programs.,[43],
,Ethereum blockchain applications are usually referred to as DApps (,decentralized application,), since they are based on the decentralized Ethereum Virtual Machine, and its smart contracts.,[44], Many uses have been proposed for Ethereum platform, including ones that are impossible or unfeasible.,[45],[29], Use case proposals have included finance, the ,internet-of-things,, ,farm-to-table, produce, ,electricity sourcing and pricing,, and ,sports betting,. Ethereum is (as of 2017) the leading ,blockchain, platform for ,initial coin offering, projects, with over 50% market share.
,As of January 2018, there are more than 250 live DApps, with hundreds more under development. Some application examples include: digital signature algorithms, securitized tokens, digital rights management, crowdfunding, prediction markets, remittance, online gambling, social media platforms, financial exchanges and identity systems.
,
,Enterprise software,
,Ethereum-based customized software and networks, independent from the public Ethereum chain, are being tested by ,enterprise software, companies.,[46], Interested parties include ,Microsoft,, ,IBM,, ,JPMorgan Chase,,,[29],[47], ,Deloitte,,,[48], ,R3,,,[49], ,Innovate UK, (cross-border payments prototype).,[50], Barclays, UBS and Credit Suisse are experimenting with Ethereum blockchain to automate Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) II requirements.
,
,Permissioned ledgers,
,Ethereum-based ,permissioned blockchain, variants are used and being investigated for various projects.
,
,J. P. Morgan Chase, is developing a permissioned-variant of Ethereum blockchain dubbed ""Quorum"".,[51], It's designed to toe the line between private and public in the realm of shuffling derivatives and payments. The idea is to satisfy regulators who need seamless access to financial goings-on, while protecting the privacy of parties that don't wish to reveal their identities nor the details of their transactions to the general public.,[52],
,Royal Bank of Scotland, has announced that it has built a Clearing and Settlement Mechanism (CSM) based on the Ethereum distributed ledger and smart contract platform.,[53],[54],
,Performance,
,In Ethereum all smart contracts are stored publicly on every node of the blockchain, which has costs.,[55], Being a ,blockchain, means it is ,secure by design, and is an example of a distributed computing system with high ,Byzantine fault tolerance,. The downside is that performance issues arise in that every node is calculating all the smart contracts in real time, resulting in lower speeds.,[55], As of January 2016, the Ethereum protocol could process 25 transactions per second.,[55], In comparison, the ,Visa, payment platform processes 45,000 payments per second leading some to question the scalability of Ethereum.,[56], On 19 December 2016, Ethereum exceeded one million transactions in a single day for the first time.,[57],
,
,Micro Raiden was launched November 2017.,[58],
,Buterin and Joseph Poon (a co-author of ,Bitcoin,'s ,Lightning Network, whitepaper) announced in 2017 their plan to launch a scaling solution called Plasma which creates ""child"" blockchains to the ""main"" parent blockchain.,[59], The plasma project has skeptics; specifically, Vlad Zamfir (Ethereum's lead researcher on proof of stake) has publicly questioned the plasma project's viability.,[59],
,Ethereum engineers have been working on ,sharding, the calculations, and the next step (called Ethereum 2) was presented at Ethereum's Devcon 3 in November 2017.,[60],
,Ethereum's blockchain uses ,Merkle trees,, for security reasons, to improve scalability, and to optimize transaction hashing.,[61], As with any Merkle tree implementation, it allows for storage savings, set membership proofs (called ""Merkle proofs""), and light client synchronization. The Ethereum network has at times faced congestion problems, for example, congestion occurred during late 2017 in relation to ,Cryptokitties,.,[62],
,
,Development Governance and EIP,
,In October 2015,,[63], a development governance was proposed as ,Ethereum Improvement Proposal,, aka ,EIP,, standardized on EIP-1.,[64], The core development group and community were to gain consensus by a process regulated EIP. A few notable decisions were made in the process of EIP, such as EIP-160 (EXP cost increase caused by Spurious Dragon Hardfork),[65], and ,EIP-20 (ERC-20 Token Standard),.,[66], In January 2018, the EIP process was finalized and published as EIP-1 status turned ""active"".,[63],
,
,Criticisms,
,Izabella Kaminska, the editor of ,FT Alphaville,, has pointed out that criminals are using Ethereum to run ,Ponzi schemes, and other forms of investment fraud.,[67], The article was based on a paper from the ,University of Cagliari,, which placed the number of Ethereum smart contracts which facilitate Ponzi schemes at nearly 10% of 1384 smart contracts examined. However, it also estimated that only 0.05% of the transactions on the network were related to such contracts.,[68],

,历史,[,编辑,],
,在2014年，IPFS协议利用,比特币,区塊链,协议,（,英语,：,Bitcoin protocol,）,和网络基础设施的优势来存储不可更改的数据，移除网络上的重复文件，以及获取存储节点的地址信息——用以搜索网络中的文件。,[5],
,目前的实现采用,Go,[6],和,JavaScript,[7],，并有,Python,的实现正在发展。,[8],Go实现被认为是开发正式,规范,（,英语,：,Specification (technical standard),）,时的“参考实现”,[9],[10],。
,
,描述,[,编辑,],
,IPFS是一个对等的分布式文件系统，它尝试为所有计算设备连接同一个文件系统。在某些方面，IPFS类似于,万维网,，但它也可以被视作一个独立的,BitTorrent,群、在同一个,Git,仓库中交换对象。换种说法，IPFS提供了一个高吞吐量、按内容寻址的,块存储,模型，及与内容相关,超連結,。,[11],这形成了一个广义的,Merkle,（,英语,：,Merkle tree,）,有向无环图,（DAG）。IPFS结合了,分散式雜湊表,、鼓励块交换和一个自我认证的命名空间。IPFS没有单点故障，并且节点不需要相互信任。,[12],分布式内容传递可以节约带宽，和防止HTTP方案可能遇到的DDoS攻击。
,该文件系统可以通过多种方式访问，包括,FUSE,与,HTTP,。将本地文件添加到IPFS文件系统可使其面向全世界可用。文件表示基于其哈希，因此有利于缓存。文件的分发采用一个基于BitTorrent的协议。其他查看内容的用户也有助于将内容提供给网络上的其他人。IPFS有一个称为IPNS的名称服务，它是一个基于,PKI,的全局命名空间，用于构筑信任链，这与其他NS兼容，并可以映射,DNS,、.onion、.bit等到IPNS。,[13],
,
,Merkle数据格式,[,编辑,],
,每个,Merkle,都是一个,有向无环图, ，因为每个节点都通过其名称访问。每个Merkle分支都是其本地内容的哈希，它们的子节点使用它们的哈希而非完整内容来命名。因此，在创建后将不能编辑节点。这可以防止循环（假设没有,哈希碰撞,），因为无法将第一个创建的节点链接到最后一个节点从而创建最后一个引用。
,对任何Merkle来说，要创建一个新的分支或验证现有分支，通常需要在本地内容的某些组合体（例如列表的子哈希和其他字节）上使用一种哈希算法。IPFS中有多种散列算法可用。

,Plain text vs. rich text,[,edit,],
,Main articles: ,Plain text, and ,Rich text,
,There are important differences between plain text (created and edited by text editors) and ,rich text, (such as that created by ,word processors, or ,desktop publishing software,). 
,Plain text exclusively consists of character representation. Each character is represented by a fixed-length sequence of one, two, or four bytes, or as a variable-length sequence of one to four bytes, in accordance to specific ,character encoding, conventions, such as ,ASCII,, ,ISO/IEC 2022,,  ,UTF-8,, or ,Unicode,. These conventions define many printable characters, but also ,non-printing characters, that control the flow of the text, such ,space,, ,line break,, and ,page break,. Plain text contains no other information about the text itself, not even the character encoding convention employed. Plain text is stored in ,text files,, although text files do not exclusively store plain text. In the early days of computers, plain text was displayed using a ,monospace font,, such that horizontal alignment and columnar formatting were sometimes done using whitespace characters. For compatibility reasons, this tradition has not changed.
,Rich text, on the other hand, may contain metadata, character formatting data (e.g. ,typeface, size, weight and style,), paragraph formatting data (e.g. indentation, alignment, letter and word distribution, and space between lines or other paragraphs), and page specification data (e.g. size, margin and reading direction). Rich text can be very complex. Rich text can be saved in ,binary format, (e.g. ,DOC,), text files adhering to a ,markup language, (e.g. ,RTF, or ,HTML,), or in a hybrid form of both (e.g. ,Office Open XML,).
,Text editors are intended to open and save text files containing either plain text or anything that can be interpreted as plain text, including the markup for rich text or the markup for something else (e.g. ,SVG,).
,
,History,[,edit,],
,  ,A box of ,punched cards, with several program decks.,
,Before text editors existed, computer text was punched into ,cards, with ,keypunch, machines. Physical boxes of these thin cardboard cards were then inserted into a card-reader. Magnetic tape and disk ""card-image"" files created from such card decks often had no line-separation characters at all, and assumed fixed-length 80-character records. An alternative to cards was punched paper tape. It could be created by some ,teleprinters, (such as the ,Teletype,), which used special characters to indicate ends of records.
,The first text editors were ,""line editors"", oriented to teleprinter- or ,typewriter,-style terminals without displays. Commands (often a single keystroke) effected edits to a file at an imaginary insertion point called the ""cursor"". Edits were verified by typing a command to print a small section of the file, and periodically by printing the entire file. In some line editors, the cursor could be moved by commands that specified the line number in the file, text ,strings, (context) for which to search, and eventually ,regular expressions,. Line editors were major improvements over keypunching. Some line editors could be used by keypunch; editing commands could be taken from a deck of cards and applied to a specified file. Some common line editors supported a ""verify"" mode in which change commands displayed the altered lines.
,When ,computer terminals, with video screens became available, ,screen-based text editors, (sometimes called just ""screen editors"") became common. One of the earliest full-screen editors was ,O26,, which was written for the operator console of the ,CDC 6000 series, computers in 1967. Another early full-screen editor was ,vi,. Written in the 1970s, it is still a standard editor,[5], on ,Unix, and ,Linux, operating systems.  Also written in the 1970s was the ,UCSD Pascal, Screen Oriented Editor, which was optimized both for indented source code as well as general text.,[6], ,Emacs,, one of the first ,free and open source software, projects, is another early full-screen or real-time editor, one that was ,ported, to many systems.,[7], A full-screen editor's ease-of-use and speed (compared to the line-based editors) motivated many early purchases of video terminals.,[8],
,The core data structure in a text editor is the one that manages the string (sequence of characters) or list of ,records, that represents the current state of the file being edited.
While the former could be stored in a single long consecutive ,array, of characters,
the desire for text editors that could more quickly insert text, delete text, and undo/redo previous edits led to the development of more complicated sequence data structures.,[9],
A typical text editor uses a ,gap buffer,, a ,linked list, of lines (as in ,PaperClip,), a ,piece table,, or a ,rope,, as its sequence data structure.
,
,Types of text editors,[,edit,],
,  ,Emacs, a text editor popular among programmers, running on ,Microsoft Windows,
,Some text editors are small and simple, while others offer broad and complex functions. For example, ,Unix, and Unix-like operating systems have the ,pico, editor (or a variant), but many also include the ,vi, and Emacs editors. ,Microsoft Windows, systems come with the simple ,Notepad,, though many people—especially programmers—prefer other ,editors, with more features. Under ,Apple Macintosh,'s ,classic Mac OS, there was the native ,SimpleText,, which was replaced in ,Mac OS X, by ,TextEdit,, which combines features of a text editor with those typical of a word processor such as rulers, margins and multiple font selection. These features are not available simultaneously, but must be switched by user command, or through the program automatically determining the ,file type,. 
,Most word processors can read and write files in plain text format, allowing them to open files saved from text editors. Saving these files from a word processor, however, requires ensuring the file is written in ,plain text, format, and that any ,text encoding, or ,BOM, settings won't obscure the file for its intended use. Non-,WYSIWYG, word processors, such as ,WordStar,, are more easily pressed into service as text editors, and in fact were commonly used as such during the 1980s. The default ,file format, of these word processors often resembles a markup language, with the basic format being plain text and visual formatting achieved using non-printing ,control characters, or ,escape sequences,. Later word processors like ,Microsoft Word, store their files in a ,binary format, and are almost never used to edit plain text files.,[10],
,Some text editors can ,edit unusually large files, such as ,log files, or an entire ,database, placed in a single file. Simpler text editors may just read files into the computer's main ,memory,. With larger files, this may be a slow process, and the entire file may not fit.  Some text editors do not let the user start editing until this read-in is complete. Editing performance also often suffers in nonspecialized editors, with the editor taking seconds or even minutes to respond to keystrokes or navigation commands. By only storing the visible portion of large files in memory, editing performance improves.
,Some editors are programmable, meaning, e.g., they can be customized for specific uses. With a programmable editor it is easy to automate repetitive tasks or, add new functionality or even implement a new application within the framework of the editor.  One common motive for customizing is to make a text editor use the commands of another text editor with which the user is more familiar, or to duplicate missing functionality the user has come to depend on. Software developers often use editor customizations tailored to the programming language or development environment they are working in. The programmability of some text editors is limited to enhancing the core editing functionality of the program, but ,Emacs, can be extended far beyond editing text files—for web browsing, reading email, online chat, managing files or playing games. Emacs can even emulate ,Vi,, its rival in the traditional ,editor wars, of ,Unix culture,.,[11],[12],
,An important group of programmable editors uses ,REXX,[a], as a scripting language. These ""orthodox editors"" contain a ""command line"" into which commands and macros can be typed and text lines into which line commands,[b], and macros can be typed. Most such editors are derivatives of ,ISPF/PDF, ,EDIT, or of ,XEDIT,, IBM's flagship editor for ,VM/SP, through ,z/VM,. Among them are ,THE,, ,KEDIT,, X2, Uni-edit, and ,SEDIT,.
,A text editor written or customized for a specific use can determine what the user is editing and assist the user, often by ,completing, programming terms and showing ,tooltips, with relevant documentation.  Many text editors for software developers include source code ,syntax highlighting, and automatic ,indentation, to make programs easier to read and write.  Programming editors often let the user select the name of an ,include file,, ,function, or ,variable,, then jump to its definition. Some also allow for easy navigation back to the original section of code by storing the initial cursor location or by displaying the requested definition in a ,popup window, or temporary buffer. Some editors implement this ability themselves, but often an auxiliary utility like ,ctags, is used to locate the definitions.
,
,Typical features,[,edit,],
,Find and replace, – Text editors provide extensive facilities for searching and replacing text, either on groups of files or interactively. Advanced editors can use ,regular expressions, to search and edit text or code.,
,Cut, copy, and paste, – most text editors provide methods to duplicate and move text within the file, or between files.,
,Ability to handle ,UTF-8, encoded text.,
,Text formatting, – Text editors often provide basic formatting features like ,line wrap,, ,auto-indentation,, ,bullet list, formatting using ,ASCII, characters, ,comment formatting,, ,syntax highlighting, and so on.,
,Undo and redo, – As with word processors, text editors provide a way to undo and redo the last edit, or more.  Often—especially with older text editors—there is only one level of edit history remembered and successively issuing the undo command will only ""toggle"" the last change.  Modern or more complex editors usually provide a multiple-level history such that issuing the undo command repeatedly will revert the document to successively older edits.  A separate redo command will cycle the edits ""forward"" toward the most recent changes.  The number of changes remembered depends upon the editor and is often configurable by the user.,
,Advanced features,[,edit,],
,Macro or procedure definition: to define new commands or features as combinations of prior commands or other macros, perhaps with passed parameters, or with nesting of macros.,
,Multi-file editing: the ability to edit multiple files during an edit-session, perhaps remembering the current-line cursor of each file, to insert repeated text into each file, move text among files, etc.,
,Data transformation, – Reading or merging the contents of another text file into the file currently being edited.  Some text editors provide a way to insert the output of a command issued to the operating system's ,shell,. Also, a case-shifting feature could translate to lowercase or uppercase.,
,Filtering, – Some advanced text editors allow the editor to send all or sections of the file being edited to another utility and read the result back into the file in place of the lines being ""filtered"".  This, for example, is useful for sorting a series of lines alphabetically or numerically, doing mathematical computations, indenting ,source code,, and so on.,
,Syntax highlighting, – contextually highlights ,source code,, ,markup languages,, ,config files, and other text that appears in an organized or predictable format. Editors generally allow users to customize the colors or styles used for each language element. Some text editors also allow users to install and use ,themes, to change the ,look and feel, of the editor's entire ,user interface,.,
,Extensibility, - a text editor intended for use by programmers must provide some ,plugin, mechanism, or be ,scriptable,, so a programmer can customize the editor with features needed to manage individual software projects, customize functionality or ,key bindings, for specific ,programming languages, or ,version control, systems, or conform to specific ,coding styles,.,
,Specialised editors,[,edit,],
,Some editors include special features and extra functions, for instance,
,
,Source code editors, are text editors with additional functionality to facilitate the production of source code.  These often feature user-programmable syntax highlighting and code navigation functions as well as coding tools or keyboard ,macros, similar to an HTML editor (see below).,
,Folding editors,. This subclass includes so-called ""orthodox editors"" that are derivatives of Xedit. Editors that implement folding without programing-specific features are usually called outliners (see below).,
,IDEs, (integrated development environments) are designed to manage and streamline large programming projects.  They are usually only used for programming as they contain many features unnecessary for simple text editing.,
,World Wide Web, authors are offered a variety of ,HTML editors, dedicated to the task of creating ,web pages,. These include: ,Dreamweaver,, ,KompoZer, and ,E Text Editor,.  Many offer the option of viewing a work in progress on a built-in ,HTML rendering engine, or standard ,web browser,. Most ,web development, is done in a ,dynamic programming language, such as ,Ruby, or ,PHP, using a source code editor or IDE. The HTML delivered by all but the simplest static web sites is stored as individual ,template files, that are assembled by the software controlling the site and do not compose a complete HTML document.,
,Mathematicians, physicists, and computer scientists often produce articles and books using ,TeX, or ,LaTeX, in plain text files. Such documents are often produced by a standard text editor, but some people use specialized ,TeX editors,.,
,Outliners,. Also called tree-based editors, because they combine a hierarchical outline tree with a text editor. Folding (see above) can be considered a specialized form of outlining.,
,Collaborative editors, allow multiple users to work on the same document simultaneously from remote locations over a network. The changes made by individual users are tracked and merged into the document automatically to eliminate the possibility of conflicting edits. These editors also typically include an ,online chat, component for discussion among editors.,
,Simultaneous editing, is a technique in ,End-user development, research to edit all items in a multiple selection. It allows the user to manipulate all the selected items at once through ,direct manipulation,. The ,Lapis text editor,[13],[14], and the ,multi edit,[15], plugin for ,gedit, are examples of this technique. The Lapis editor can also create an automatic multiple selection based on an example item.,
,Distraction-free editors, provide a ,minimalistic, interface with the purpose of isolating the writer from the rest of the applications and operating system, thus being able to focus on the writing without distractions from interface elements like a ,toolbar, or ,notification area,.,
,Programmable editors can usually be enhanced to perform any or all of these functions, but simpler editors focus on just one, or, like ,gPHPedit,, are targeted at a single programming language.

,^, ,Originally macros were written in assembler, ,CLIST, (,TSO,), ,CMS EXEC, (,VM,), ,EXEC2, (VM/SE) or ,PL/I,, but most users dropped CLIST, EXEC and EXEC2 once REXX was available.,
,
,^, ,A line command is a command typed into the sequence number entry area associated with a specific line of text and whose scope is limited to that line, or, in the case of a block command, associated with the block of lines between the beginning and ending line commands. An example of the latter would be typing the command ,ucc, (block upper case) into the entry areas of two lines; this has the same effect as typing ,uc, (upper case) into the entry area of each line in the range.,

,Guido van Rossum, (,Dutch: ,[ˈɣido vɑn ˈrɔsʏm, -səm],; born 31 January 1956) is a Dutch ,programmer, best known as the author of the ,Python programming language,, for which he was the "",Benevolent dictator for life,"" (BDFL) until he stepped down from the position in July 2018.,[6],[7],

,

,Life and education,[,edit,],
,Van Rossum was born and raised in the ,Netherlands,, where he received a master's degree in mathematics and ,computer science, from the ,University of Amsterdam, in 1982. He has a brother, Just van Rossum, who is a ,type designer, and programmer who designed the ,typeface, used in the ""Python Powered"" logo.,[,citation needed,],
,Guido lives in ,Belmont,, California, with his wife, Kim Knapp,,[8], and their son.,[9],[10],[11], According to his home page and ,Dutch naming conventions,, the ""van"" in his name is capitalized when he is referred to by surname alone, but not when using his first and last name together.,[12],
,
,Work,[,edit,],
,While working at the ,Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, (CWI), Van Rossum wrote and contributed a ,glob(), routine to ,BSD, ,Unix, in 1986,[13],[14], and helped develop the ,ABC programming language,. He once stated, ""I try to mention ABC's influence because I'm indebted to everything I learned during that project and to the people who worked on it."",[15], He also created ,Grail,, an early ,web browser, written in Python, and engaged in discussions about the ,HTML, standard.,[16],
,He has worked for various research institutes, including the ,Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, (CWI) in the Netherlands, the U.S. ,National Institute of Standards and Technology, (NIST), and the ,Corporation for National Research Initiatives, (CNRI). From 2000 until 2003 he worked for ,Zope, corporation. In 2003 van Rossum left Zope for Elemental Security. While there he worked on a custom programming language for the organization.,[17], From 2005 to December 2012, he worked at ,Google,, where he spent half of his time developing the Python language. In January 2013, he started working for ,Dropbox,.,[4],
,
,Python,[,edit,],
,  ,Van Rossum at the 2008 ,Google I/O, Developer's Conference.,
,  ,Van Rossum at the 2006 ,O'Reilly Open Source Convention, (OSCON),
,In December 1989, Van Rossum had been looking for a 'hobby' programming project that would keep [him] occupied during the week around Christmas"" as his office was closed when he decided to write an ,interpreter, for a ""new scripting language [he] had been thinking about lately: a descendant of ,ABC, that would appeal to ,Unix,/,C, hackers"". He attributes choosing the name ""Python"" to ""being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of ,Monty Python's Flying Circus,)"".,[18],
,He has explained that Python's predecessor, ,ABC,, was inspired by ,SETL,, noting that ABC co-developer ,Lambert Meertens, had ""spent a year with the SETL group at ,NYU, before coming up with the final ABC design"".,[19],
,In July 2018, Van Rossum announced that he would be stepping down from the position of ,BDFL, of the Python programming language.,[20],
,
,Computer Programming for Everybody,[,edit,],
,In 1999, Van Rossum submitted a funding proposal to ,DARPA, called "",Computer Programming for Everybody,,"" in which he further defined his goals for Python:
,
,An easy and intuitive language just as powerful as major competitors,
,Open source,, so anyone can contribute to its development,
,Code that is as understandable as plain English,
,Suitability for everyday tasks, allowing for short development times,
,Python has grown to become a popular programming language. As of October 2017, it was the second most popular language on ,GitHub,, a social coding website, behind ,JavaScript, and ahead of ,Java,.,[21], According to a programming language popularity survey,[22], it is consistently amongst the top 10 most mentioned languages in job postings. Furthermore, Python is consistently,[,clarification needed,], in the top 10 most popular languages according to the ,TIOBE Programming Community Index,.,[23],
,
,Mondrian,[,edit,],
,Not to be confused with ,Mondrian (software),, data visualisation software, or ,Mondrian OLAP server,.,
,At Google, Van Rossum developed Mondrian, a web-based ,code review, system written in Python and used within the company. He named the software after the Dutch painter ,Piet Mondriaan,.,[24], He named another related ,software project, after ,Gerrit Rietveld,, a Dutch designer.,[25],
,
,Dropbox,[,edit,],
,In 2013, Van Rossum started working at the ,cloud file storage, company ,Dropbox,.,[26],
,
,Awards,[,edit,],
,At the 2002 ,FOSDEM, conference in ,Brussels,, Van Rossum received the 2001 ,Award for the Advancement of Free Software, from the ,Free Software Foundation, (FSF) for his work on Python.,
,In May 2003, he received a ,NLUUG, Award.,[27],
,In 2006, he was recognized as a Distinguished Engineer by the ,Association for Computing Machinery,.,
,In 2018, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History museum.,[28],

,Extensibility, is a ,software engineering, and ,systems design, principle where the implementation takes future growth into consideration.  The term extensibility can also be seen as a systemic measure of the ability to extend a ,system, and the level of effort required to implement the extension.  Extensions can be through the addition of new functionality or through modification of existing functionality.  The central theme is to provide for change – typically enhancements – while minimizing impact to existing system functions.
,An extensible ,system, is one whose internal structure and ,dataflow, are minimally or not affected by new or modified functionality, for example recompiling or changing the original ,source code, might be unnecessary when changing a system’s behavior, either by the creator or other programmers.,[1], Because software systems are long lived and will be modified for new features and added functionalities demanded by users, extensibility enables developers to expand or add to the software’s capabilities and facilitates systematic reuse. Some of its approaches include facilities for allowing users’ own program routines to be inserted and the abilities to define new data types as well as to define new formatting markup tags.,[2],

,Extensible design,[,edit,],
,Extensible design in software engineering is to accept that not everything can be designed in advance. A light ,software framework, which allows for changes is provided instead. Small commands are made to prevent from losing the element of extensibility, following the principle of separating work elements into comprehensible units, in order to avoid traditional ,software development, issues including low ,cohesion, and high ,coupling, and allow for continued development. Embracing change is essential to the extensible design, in which additions will be continual. Each chunk of the system will be workable with any changes, and the idea of change through addition is the center of the whole system design.
Extensible design supports frequent re-prioritization and allows functionality to be implemented in small steps upon request, which are the principles advocated by the Agile methodologies and iterative development. Extensibility imposes fewer and cleaner dependencies during development, as well as reduced coupling and more cohesive abstractions, plus well defined interfaces.,[3],
,
,Importance,[,edit,],
,Fickleness lies at the basis of all software because of human phenomena since software is an “evolving entity” which is developed and maintained by human beings, yielding ongoing system changes in software specification and implementation. Components of a software are often developed and deployed by unrelated parties independently. Adaptable software components are necessary since components from external vendors are unlikely to fit into a specific deployment scenario off-the-rack, taking third party users other than the manufacturer into consideration. Many software systems and software product-lines are derived from a base system, which share a common ,software architecture, or sometimes large parts of the functionality and implementation but are possibly equipped with different components that require an extensible base system.,[4],
,Building software systems that are ,independently extensible, is an important challenge.
An ,independently extensible, system not only allows two people to independently develop extensions to the system, but also allows the two extensions to be combined without a global integrity check.,[5],
,
,Classification of extensibility mechanisms,[,edit,],
,There are three different forms of software extensibility: white-box extensibility, gray-box extensibility, and black-box extensibility, which are based on what artifacts and the way they are changed.
,
,White-Box,[,edit,],
,Under this form of extensibility, a software system can be extended by modifying the ,source code,, and it is the most flexible and the least restrictive form. There are two sub-forms of extensibility, open-box extensibility and glass-box extensibility, depending on how changes are applied.
,
,Open-Box,[,edit,],
,Changes are performed invasively in open-box extensible systems; i.e. original source code is directly being hacked into. It requires available source code and the modification permitted source code license. Open-box extensibility is most relevant to bug fixing, internal code refactoring, or production of next version of a software product.
,
,Glass-Box,[,edit,],
,Glass-box extensibility (also called architecture driven frameworks) allows a software system to be extended with available source code, but may not allow the code to be modified. Extensions have to be separated from the original system in a way that the original system is not affected. One example of this form of extensibility is object-oriented application frameworks which achieve extensibility typically by using inheritance and dynamic binding.
,
,Black-Box,[,edit,],
,In ,black-box, extensibility (also called data-driven frameworks) no details about a system’s implementation are used for implementing deployments or extensions; only ,interface specifications, are provided. This type of approach is more limited than the various white-box approaches. Black-box extensions are typically achieved through system configuration applications or the use of application-specific scripting languages by defining components interfaces.
,
,Gray-Box,[,edit,],
,Gray-box extensibility is a compromise between a pure white-box and a pure black-box approach, which does not rely fully on the exposure of source code. Programmers could be given the system’s specialization interface which lists all available abstractions for refinement and specifications on how extensions should be developed.,[6],
,
,Extensibility vs. reusability,[,edit,],
,Extensibility and reusability have many emphasized properties in common, including low coupling, modularity and high cohesion. Software reusability is boosted by extensibility and refers to software elements’ ability to construct for many different software systems, which is motivated by the observation of software systems often sharing common elements. Reusability together with extensibility allows a technology to be transferred to another project with less development and maintenance time, as well as enhanced reliability and consistency.,[7],
,
,Security,[,edit,],
,Modern operating systems support extensibility through ,device drivers, and ,loadable kernel modules,.  Many modern applications support extensibility through ,plug-ins,, ,extension languages,, ,applets,, etc.  The trend of increasing extensibility negatively affects software security.,[8],
,CGI is one of the primary means by which web servers provide extensibility.  Some people see CGI scripts as ""an enormous security hole"".,[9],
