      "For decades, we have been hearing that the baby-boom generation was like a pig moving through a python–bigger than the generations before and after. \n",
      "That’s true. But that’s also a very misleading metaphor for understanding the demographic forces that are driving up federal spending: They aren’t temporary. The generation born between 1946 and 1964 is the beginning of a demographic transition that will persist for decades after the baby boomers die, the consequence of lengthening lifespans and declining fertility. Putting the federal budget on a sustainable course requires long-lasting fixes, not short-lived tweaks.  \n",
      "First, a few demographic facts.\n",
      "As the chart below illustrates, there was a surge in births in the U.S. at the end of World War II, a subsequent decline, and then an uptick as baby boomers began having children.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the population has been rising, the number of births in the U.S. the past few years has been below the peak baby-boom levels, possibly because many couples chose not to have children during bad economic times. More significant, fertility rates–roughly the number of babies born per woman during her lifetime–have fallen well below pre-baby-boom levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Americans are living longer. In 1950, a man who made it to age 65 could expect to live until 78 and a woman until 81. Social Security’s actuaries project that a man who lived to age 65 in 2010 will reach 84 and a woman age 86.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Put all this together, and it’s clear that a growing fraction of the U.S. population will be 65 or older.   \n",
      "The combination of longer life spans and lower fertility rates means the ratio of elderly (over 65) to working-age population (ages 20 to 64) is rising. As the chart below illustrates, the ratio will rise steadily as more baby boomers reach retirement age–and then it levels off.  \n",

More older Americans means more federal spending on Social Security and Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly. On top of that, health care spending per person is likely to continue to grow faster than the overall economy.\n",

      "Software application developers earn large salaries in the United States, $96,260 a year on average. But in metropolitan San Jose they earn $131,270, the highest in the country. There are many partial explanations for this—local cost of living, differences in education levels, experience, and industry—but none of them quite account for it. It turns out that developers living in San Jose have acquired the specific skills most valued by employers.\n",
      " \n",
      "As the map below shows, there is a huge amount of variation in earnings for software application developers across regional labor markets. In large metropolitan areas like New York, they earn $105,000, but in Louisville, they earn just $72,000.\n",

      "The surprising thing, when it comes to software developers and other skilled occupations too, is that none of these factors can fully account for the San Jose premium. Software developers in San Jose are typically slightly less experienced, and while their levels of education are higher—including their likelihood of having majored in engineering or computer science—the difference is not enough to explain their elevated earnings. Likewise, the cost of living in San Jose is remarkably high, but comparable to other major cities. \n",

Of these, roughly 1.4 million were for software application developers, making it the most in-demand occupation. In total, 3 million ads also contained salary information, which I could use to estimate the average value of each distinct skill advertised. \n",

      " \n",
      "For example, 8.4 percent of ads for software developers in San Jose requested Java, a widely used programming language, associated with an average salary of $98,000 across all U.S. ads mentioning both it and a salary requirement. Yet, for the United States as a whole, just 5.7 percent of software developer ads required Java. In New York City, the share was 6.7, and it was 4.7 in Louisville.\n",
      " \n",
      "Other high-value programming languages and skills were disproportionately advertised in San Jose, such as Linux, C++, Python and the term “software engineering.”  These skills were much less commonly required for jobs in Louisville and even New York. Only 0.2 percent of software jobs required Python in Louisville and 1.7 in New York City, compared to 2.8 percent in San Jose. It is valued at $100,345.\n",
      " \n",
      "These and other skills contribute to the high premium enjoyed by Silicon Valley computer workers, but they could be profitably learned by a much larger swath of people, as online educators like Treehouse, Udacity, and Code Fellows aim to demonstrate.\n",

      "According to President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), approximately 3.1 million jobs will be rendered obsolete or permanently altered as a consequence of artificial intelligence technologies. Artificial intelligence (AI) will, for the foreseeable future, have a significant disruptive impact on jobs. That said, this disruption can create new opportunities if policymakers choose to harness them—including some with the potential to help address long-standing social inequities. Investing in quality training programs that deliver premium skills, such as computational analysis and cognitive thinking, provides a real opportunity to leverage AI’s disruptive power.\n",

      "AI’s disruption presents a clear challenge: competition to traditional skilled workers arising from the cross-relevance of data scientists and code engineers, who can adapt quickly to new contexts. Data analytics has become an indispensable feature of successful companies across all industries. This reality dictates that companies invest heavily in data analytics to remain competitive and profitable. Consequently, unlikely industries such as retail, banking, finance, and even agricultural firms are aggressively competing for talent with specific computational data science and programming skills. A recent IBM report expertly quantifies the scope and breadth of employers’ hiring demands, noting that “[d]emand for data-driven decision makers, such as data-enabled marketing managers, will comprise one-third of the data savvy professional job market, with a projected increase of 110,000 positions by 2020.” Herein lies a window of opportunity: the rapidly growing technical skills gap.\n",
      "Investing in high-quality education and training programs is one way that policymakers proactively attempt to address the workforce challenges presented by artificial intelligence. It is essential that we make affirmative, inclusive choices to ensure that marginalized communities participate equitably in these opportunities.\n",
      "Policymakers should prioritize understanding the demographics of those most likely to lose jobs in the short-run. As opposed to obsessively assembling case studies, we need to proactively identify policy entrepreneurs who can conceive of training policies that equip workers with technical skills of “long-game” relevance. As IBM points out, “[d]ata democratization impacts every career path, so academia must strive to make data literacy an option, if not a requirement, for every student in any field of study.”\n",
      "Machines are an equal opportunity displacer, blind to color and socioeconomic status.\n",
      "Machines are an equal opportunity displacer, blind to color and socioeconomic status. Effective policy responses require collaborative data collection and coordination among key stakeholders—policymakers, employers, and educational institutions—to  identify at-risk worker groups and to inform workforce development strategies. Machine substitution is purely an efficiency game in which workers overwhelmingly lose. Nevertheless, we can blunt these effects by identifying critical leverage points.\n",
      "Investing in innovative education and training is an excellent place to start. Bill Gates’ recent $1.7 billion investment in U.S. public schools is a sign of the way forward, which offers two compelling messages for policymakers. First, innovate and experiment until we identify the right policies. Second, prioritize high-needs schools in poor neighborhoods; they deserve distinct attention to close their opportunity gaps and prepare them to be competitive in the future workforce.\n",
      "Policymakers can choose to harness AI’s disruptive power to address workforce challenges and redesign fair access to opportunity simultaneously. We should train our collective energies on identifying practical policies that update our current agrarian-based education model, which unfairly disadvantages children from economically segregated neighborhoods. Evidence from a Harvard and New York University research study suggests attending a high-quality high school increases a student’s chances of attending a four-year college; which by extension improves their future income earning potential.\n",
      "Let me ask a bold question: how much do we lose if we experiment with substituting an entry-level data science class for machine shop or a vocational carpentry program in urban high schools and community colleges? A 2010 pilot partnership between the University of California, Los Angeles and the National Science Foundation is an encouraging sign; the pilot focuses on redesigning computer science curricula in urban high schools to include newer mobile technologies and computational analysis.\n",

      "Public policy and public affairs schools aim to train competent creators and implementers of government policy. While drawing on the principles that gird our economic and political systems to provide a well-rounded education, like law schools and business schools, policy schools provide professional training. They are quite distinct from graduate programs in political science or economics which aim to train the next generation of academics. As professional training programs, they add value by imparting both the skills which are relevant to current employers, and skills which we know will be relevant as organizations and societies evolve. \n",
      "The relevance of the skills that policy programs impart to address problems of today and tomorrow bears further discussion. We are living through an era in which societies are increasingly interconnected. The wide-scale adoption of devices such as the smartphone is having a profound impact on our culture, communities, and economy. The use of social and digital media and associated means of communication enabled by mobile devices is changing the tone, content, and geographic scope of our conversations, modifying how information is generated and consumed, and changing the very nature of citizen engagement. \n",
      "Information technology-based platforms provisioned by private providers such as Facebook, Google, Uber, and Lyft maintain information about millions of citizens and enable services such as transportation that were mediated in the past solely by the public sector. Surveillance for purposes of public safety via large-scale deployment of sensors also raises fundamental questions about information privacy. From technology-enabled global delivery of work to displacement and replacement of categories of work, some studies estimate that up to 47 percent of U.S. employment might be at risk of computerization with an attendant rise in income inequality. These technology-induced changes will affect every policy domain. How should policy programs best prepare students to address societal challenges in this world that is being transformed by technology? We believe the answer lies in educating students to be “men and women of intelligent action.” \n",
      "A model of policy education\n",
      "We begin with a skills-based model of policy education. These four essential skills address the general problems policy practitioners frequently face:\n",
      "\n",
      "Design skills to craft policy ideas \n",
      "Analytical skills to make smart ex ante decisions \n",
      "Interpersonal experience to manage policy implementation  \n",
      "Evaluative skills to assess outcomes ex post and correct course if necessary\n",
      "\n",
      "These skills make up the policy analysis toolkit required to be data driven practitioner of “intelligent action” in any policy domain. This toolkit needs to be supplemented by an understanding of how technology is transforming societal challenges, enabling new solutions, or disrupting existing regulatory regimes. This understanding is essential to policy formulation and implementation. \n",
      "Pillar 1: Design skills\n",
      "As with engineering, where design precedes analysis, this first pillar seeks to educate students in thinking creatively about problems in order to devise and develop policy ideas. Using ideas derived from design, divergent and convergent thinking principles are employed to generate, explore, and arrive at a candidate set of solutions. Using Uber as an example, an approach to identify and explore the key policy issues such as convenience, costs, driver working hours, and insurance would involve interviewing and observing both incumbent taxi drivers and Uber drivers. This in turn would lead to a set of alternatives that deserve further and careful consideration.  Using these skills, candidate designs and choices that are generated can be evaluated using the policy analytic toolkit. \n",
      "Pillar 2: Analytical skills\n",
      "At Carnegie Mellon, we are often cited in media and interrogated by peers on our approach to analytical and technology skills education. Curiosity about which skills are the “right” skills to teach policy practitioners are common, but we believe this is the wrong approach. We instead begin from the premise that policy or management decisions should be grounded in evidence.  We then determine the skills required to assemble the types of evidence that will likely be available to policy makers in the future.  In increasingly instrumented environments where citizens and infrastructure produce continuous streams of data, making sense of it all will require a somewhat different set of skills. We believe that a grounding in micro-economics, operations research, statistics, and program evaluation (aka causal inference) to be an essential core to policy programs. \n",
      "New coursework will teach students to work with multi-variable data and machine learning with an emphasis on prediction. This material ought to be part of the required coursework in statistics given the importance of prediction in many policy implementation settings. Along the same lines, the ability to work with unstructured data (especially text) and data visualization will become increasingly relevant to all students, not just those students who want to specialize in data analytics. Finally, knowledge of data manipulation and analysis languages such as Python and R for analytic work will be important because data often has to be massaged and cleansed prior to analysis. An important task for programs will be to determine the competencies expected of graduates. \n",
      "Pillar 3: Interpersonal experiences\n",
      "The third pillar of the skills-based model is interpersonal experience, where the practiced habits of good communication and steady negotiation developed with a sound understanding of organizations, their design and their behaviors. We label these purposely as experiences rather than skills because we believe they are best practiced either in the real-world or in simulated real-world settings. It is also in this pillar where practitioners learn the knowledge necessary to become credible experts in their domain. We believe that in addition to core coursework in the area, a supplementary curriculum which provides students with opportunities to gain these experiences is an essential component of our educational model.\n",

      "The ability to carefully diagnose the effectiveness of policy or management interventions is the fourth pillar of our model. It is insufficient to create and execute policy without measurement, and this is where both careful thought to the fundamental issues of measurement and evaluation become important. The ability to make objective judgments on the benefits, liabilities, and unintended consequences of prior policies is the goal of this set of skills. Here, sound statistical and econometric training with an understanding of the principles of causal inference is essential. In addition, program evaluation skills such as cost-benefit and financial analysis help practitioners round out their evaluation skills by considering both non-monetary and economic impacts.\n",
      "What should be retired?\n",
      "A skills-based approach might replace certain aspects of existing policy training.  This depends on a number of factors specific to each institution, but three generally applicable observations are clear. First, real-world experiences are a powerful way to encode domain learning as well as project management skills. Through project-based work, students can learn about institutional contexts in specific policy domains and political processes such as budgeting. Second, team-based projects allow students to learn and apply principles of management and organizational behavior. At Carnegie Mellon, we refer to these as “systems synthesis” projects, since they require students to adopt a systemic point of view and to synthesize a number of skills in their policy analysis toolkit. Third, interpersonal skills training can be practiced through activities such as weekend negotiation exercises, hackathons, and speaker series. These activities can be highly intentional and fashioned to reinforce skills rather than as a recess from the “real work” of classroom training. Since students complete graduate programs in such a short time, counseling them to focus on outcomes from day one will allow them to choose a reinforcing set of coursework and real-world experiences. \n",
      "In summary, we argue for a model of policy education that views practitioners as future problem solvers. Good policy education must consider the ways in which problems will present themselves, and the ways in which answers will obscure themselves. Rigorous training grounded in the analysis of available evidence and buoyed by real-world interpersonal experiences is a sound approach to relevant, durable policy training.\n",

      "Amidst growing frustration with the cost of higher education, complaints also abound about its quality. One critique, launched in the book Academically Adrift by two sociologists, finds little evidence that college students score better on measures of critical thinking, writing, and reasoning after attending college. This is something of a paradox, since strong evidence shows that attending college tends to raise earnings power, even for students who start with mediocre preparation. \n",
      "Our recent study uses a different approach to assess the value of a college education. We find that the particular skills listed by a college’s alumni on their resumes predict how well graduates from those schools perform in terms of earning a living, meeting debt obligations, and working for high-paying or innovative companies. Since jobs requiring more valuable skills typically require at least some college education, this finding suggests many students are gaining valuable skills from college. But the variation in alumni skills across schools is wide, even after considering the aptitude of the students in terms of their pre-admission test scores. This variation implies that what one studies and where have big effects on economic outcomes.\n",

      "Skills versus degrees\n",
      "\n",
      "It is widely known that education raises individual earnings, but education—measured in years of study or level of degree—is a very rough measure of learning. Thus, it is not surprising that studies consistently find that skills are an important predictor of economic outcomes. People with higher test scores—another measure of learning—earn higher wages, even with the same level of education. Likewise, graduates with technical degrees earn more, as do workers in occupations requiring more STEM skills. At the international scale, performance on standardized exams has a much stronger statistical relationship with economic outcomes than do years of education, according to a new OECD study.\n",

      "\n",
      "Using data from the company Burning Glass, we calculated the average salary listed for distinct skills based on 3 million job vacancy ads. To match these skills to colleges, we used data from LinkedIn’s college profile pages, which show the 25 most common skills (e.g., customer service, Microsoft Excel, Python) listed by alumni from each college. For the average college, we observed 1,150 profiles per skill. (A great advantage of using LinkedIn data is the large sample size.) We obtained data for 2,164 colleges representing profiles for 2.5 million U.S. residents who attended college. By comparison, Academically Adrift surveyed 2,300 college graduates.\n",

      "\n",
      "Measured at mid-career (meaning at least 10 years of working), salaries tend to be much higher for alumni who list high-value skills on their resumes. Earnings go up by an average of $2,600 for every decile of skill. Our more detailed empirical work shows that skills predict higher earnings even after controlling for math test scores on the ACT and SAT, as well as other student characteristics like family income.\n",
      "Cal Tech graduates list the highest-value skills (e.g., Matlab, Python, C++, algorithms, and machine learning) and typically earn $126,000 at mid-career. Other four-year schools with high-value skills and high salaries include Harvey Mudd, MIT, the Polytechnic Institute of New York University, and the Air Force Academy. \n",
      "Earnings data from two-year colleges are not as widely available, and the correlation with alumni skills is weaker, but alumni from those schools also seem to benefit from higher skills training. Top schools include the Pittsburg Institute of Aeronautics, Spartan College of Aeronautics and Technology (Tulsa, Okla.), Coleman University (San Diego), Hondros College (Columbus, Ohio), and SUNY College of Technology at Alfred.\n",

For example, not a single Harvey Mudd attendee between 2009 and 2011 defaulted on his or her federal loans within three years of leaving. Repayment rates average 95 percent for four-year colleges in the top 10 percent for alumni skills but 87 percent for those in the bottom 10 percent.

A total of 212 employers, including government agencies, made it onto a top 100 list for at least one group of student majors.

      "Earnings and other economic outcomes should not be equated with social value, and there are plenty of jobs and professions—child care, teaching, social work—that pay modestly but are nevertheless highly valuable to society. Colleges that specialize in this training or instill even moderately valuable skills in the least academically prepared students may be socially important institutions even if their alumni frequently are less affluent.\n",
      "Nonetheless, earnings clearly matter privately and socially, as does work that supports innovation and highly productive advanced industries. Many colleges offer programs of study in fields that appear to have almost no market value—nor even any social value since the knowledge acquired is never put to use, at least through paid employment. In this sense, how well colleges instill highly valuable skills and prepare students to contribute productively to the economy should be an important consideration when evaluating schools. Colleges that do this for the students least likely to otherwise succeed are offering an even more beneficial service, as we have discussed in our value-added college research.\n",

      "TITLE: \n",
      "While the world is fixated on Iraq and the Middle East, North Korea continues to pose at least as great a threat to Western security interests. Six-party talks with the North Koreans in Beijing have just showed that the Bush administration hasn’t yet found a way out of the nuclear crisis. Although negotiations appear likely to resume in a couple of months, their prospects for success seem poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The basic dilemma is easy to understand. North Korea will not surrender its nuclear capabilities, which are among its only valuable national assets, unless offered a very good deal for giving them up. President Bush refuses to offer such a deal because he sees the North Korean demand as blackmail. He insists that before any talks about better diplomatic relations or economic interaction occur, North Korea first relinquish—with verification—a nuclear program it had pledged nine years ago to abandon completely. At most, Bush may, as an interim gesture, offer to sign a multilateral accord in which all six parties (the two Koreas, the United States, China, Japan and Russia) pledge not to attack each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, in fits and starts North Korea continues its gradual progress toward a larger nuclear capability. Given the regime’s desperate economic straits, its erratic and eccentric and isolated regime and its threats last April that it might even export nuclear materials if circumstances got bad enough, this is extremely bad news.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the extent the Bush administration has a plan for addressing this crisis, it is a strategy of pressure. It insisted on the six-party negotiating format because that allows the other five parties all to insist that North Korea de-nuclearize. That kind of setting also deprives North Korea of its bluster and brinkmanship tactics.\n",

      "For example, when the delegation from Pyongyang used the recent Beijing meeting to accuse the Bush administration of harboring aggressive designs on North Korea, Russia countered that it was confident the United States had no such intention. The Bush administration also has established a creative concept known as the proliferation security initiative, by which countries such as the United States, Japan, Australia, France and Germany make use of existing national laws to inspect North Korean ships in their waters—complicating North Korea’s efforts to smuggle illicit weapons, drugs and counterfeit currency.\n",

      "And the military card is still on the table in principle as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Bush administration’s strategy is unlikely to work. Faced with gradual economic strangulation, North Korea’s stubborn and spiteful regime would probably again let its people starve—and perhaps consider selling dangerous weapons to terrorists—before crying uncle. Moreover, China, South Korea and Japan are far from ready to apply such a “python strategy.” China publicly criticized the United States for having an inflexible stance in last month’s talks.\n",

      "Japan and South Korea both insisted on presenting a more conciliatory package of incentives to North Korea in Beijing than Washington was prepared to countenance. And none of our three key regional partners has any interest whatever in a military option at this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Faced with this dilemma, we need to think bigger. We must offer much more to North Korea but demand far more in return. The goal should be to push North Korea, which has shown increasing interest in economic reform, to seriously attempt such reform—building on the precedents offered by China and Vietnam in the past two decades. If North Korea is willing and takes steps, such as cutting its conventional military forces, that are needed to give such a plan any hope of success, we can be generous in return. This would not be giving in to blackmail; it would be a form of assisted suicide for the Stalinist ways of the North Korean regime. Even if Kim Jong Il and his cronies survived the transition, their rule would be radically transformed.\n",
      "\n",
      "This plan would require the help of all six parties that are now part of the negotiating process. Chinese economists and technicians would teach the North Koreans how to carry out market reforms. Russia would reassure Kim Jong Il and his military commanders that intrusive arms control verification can be done without opening up the country to attack. Japan and South Korea would provide aid and investment; South Korea would also have to make at least modest cuts in its conventional forces in return for much deeper cuts in the oversized North Korean military.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the nuclear and conventional military issues, North Korea would also agree to verifiable elimination of its chemical weapons and ballistic missiles. It would cease counterfeiting and drug trafficking. It would have to let all Japanese kidnapping victims leave and begin a human rights dialogue with the outside world. It would continue to abstain from terrorism and provocative actions against its neighbors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United States would, for its part, ease trade sanctions immediately and ultimately lift them. It would, together with its regional partners and international financial institutions, provide at least $2 billion a year in aid to North Korea. The aid would not be in the form of cash (or new nuclear reactors), and would not be provided in one big dose but would be disbursed incrementally—while we watched to make sure North Korea was also holding up its end of the grand bargain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diplomatic ties and security assurances leading to a full peace treaty would also be appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, this approach might well fail. North Korean leaders may, for example, believe they need nuclear weapons to deter the Bush administration from another preemptive action against another charter member of the axis of evil. But it would be a major mistake to act on that assumption before testing it. And if we try and fail, coercive policies may then become possible, as our regional partners will have a much harder time claiming that diplomacy has not yet been seriously attempted.\n",

      "TITLE: \n",
      "America’s urban landscape is changing. The familiar distinctions between central cities and suburbs and between the growing Sunbelt and the more stagnant Frostbelt parts of the country are being complicated by new demographic trends, two in particular. The first trend is the sharp rise in immigration to the United States. Each year about one million people, predominantly Latin American and Asian in origin, arrive in the United States, most settling in urban areas. The second trend involves the baby-boomers. This large cohort of 76 million people?often termed “the pig in the python”?is now aging toward the tail of that python. Most boomers will not move but “age in place”?in the suburbs rather than in the city. Both these trends will have important effects on urban America.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the “White-Black, City-Suburb” Typology \n",
      "For much of the postwar period, discussions of race and space in urban America revolved around black migration to central cities and “white flight” to the suburbs. The new immigration that is infusing many urban areas with new residents from a variety of backgrounds suggests the need for a new way of thinking about the demographic profiles of cities and suburbs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The impact of immigration is apparent from a glance at the central counties (those that contain a metropolitan area’s central-city population) showing greatest population gains during 1990?99. The two largest gainers, Maricopa County, home of Phoenix, and Clark County, home of Las Vegas, achieved most of their gains from domestic migration?migrants from other parts of the United States. Yet each of the next five central counties with the greatest population gains?those of the Los Angeles, Houston, San Diego, Miami, and Dallas metropolitan areas?registered a net loss of domestic migrants. Their gains came entirely from international migration and natural increase. Were it not for immigration, the population of these areas, and of several other large central counties, would register far smaller growth or outright declines. Indeed, areas that do not attract nearly as many immigrants?the central counties of Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Cleveland, and Buffalo, among others?lost population over the 1990s.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because conventional city-suburb, black-white demographic profiles do not take adequate account of this new immigration, I offer a new typology of the nation’s large metropolitan areas, those with populations greater than 1 million (see table 1).\n",

      "The typology begins with a Multiethnic High Immigration category of 12 metropolitan areas with high immigration and a significant Asian or Hispanic presence. The largest of these areas are New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco. Four other categories cover areas that have a primarily black minority presence and those that are mostly white; and within each, those growing at a relatively high pace and those growing only modestly. These four categories are: White-Black Fast-Growing (for example, Atlanta), White-Black Slow-Growing (Detroit), Mostly White Fast-Growing (Las Vegas), and Mostly White Slow-Growing (Pittsburgh).\n",
      "\n",
      "In metropolitan areas where white-black racial dynamics have been a historically important demographic dimension, the slow-growing areas tend to be in the Rustbelt (New Orleans being an exception), and the fast-growing areas are located in the Southeast, which has now begun to attract back significant numbers of African Americans. Mostly White Fast-Growing areas are located primarily in the West and Midwest (Orlando, Nashville, and West Palm Beach excepted). Mostly White Slow-Growing areas are located in the Northeast and Midwest (Louisville excepted).\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Table 2 gives the composite racial profiles for cities and suburbs in each of these five categories. Multiethnic High Immigration areas clearly have the greatest diversity both in their cities and in their suburbs although the suburbs remain majority white. Among the White-Black categories, the slow-growing areas show a lesser tendency toward black suburbanization.\n",
      "\n",
      "What these statistics show is that the conventional view of cities as being in decline and as having predominantly black populations fails to take into account recent changes in the urban scene. Today some of the nation’s fastest-growing cities are gaining population from domestic migration and are mostly white. And several large multiethnic metropolitan areas house “majority minorities” in their cities and may soon do so in their suburbs as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old “city-suburb” typology also fails to recognize heterogeneous growth patterns within the suburbs. Many inner and even middle suburbs are experiencing demographic dynamics similar to those of the cities. This is especially the case in some of the largest “melting pot” metropolitan areas. A look at the immigration and domestic migration dynamics for counties within the greater Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York CMSAs (Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas) shows that it is not just the inner counties whose gains are attributable solely to international migration. Of the 29 counties in the greater New York CMSA, fully 20 registered negative domestic migration during 1990?99 and achieved their only migration growth from immigration from abroad. The same goes for 4 of the 5 counties in the Los Angeles CMSA and for 7 of the 10 counties of the San Francisco CMSA.\n",
      "\n",
      "The heterogeneity of suburbs was already apparent in 1990. Figure 1 compares the Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Detroit metropolitan areas. The racially diverse suburbs of Los Angeles, with their infusion of immigrants and new ethnic minorities, contrast with the suburbs of Atlanta, which show moderate racial heterogeneity, and those of slower-growing Detroit, where historical racial antagonisms keep the divide between city and suburbs fairly sharp.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suburban growth patterns continue to favor the outer suburbs. Of the 30 counties that made the fastest gains via net domestic migration during 1990?99, most that are in metropolitan areas lie in the outer suburban reaches of fast-growing metropolitan areas such as Denver, Atlanta, Las Vegas, Dallas, and Houston. Even in the fast-growing, less dense portions of the country, an outer suburban residence remains popular.\n",
      "Aging Boomers, Cities, and Suburbs\n",
      "Since the baby-boom generation began entering grade school in the 1950s, it has been followed closely by marketers, policymakers, and political consultants. But the boomers’ sharp disengagement from the residential aspects of city life seems to have escaped the notice of urban watchers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aging of the nation’s first suburban generation will increase substantially the number of households in their 50s and early 60s over the next 10 years. Early boomers?born between 1945 and 1955?will be making the transition from empty-nesters to preretirees. Many will retire from regular jobs. Some will leave their suburban homes. But most will “age in place” or perhaps make a local move.\n",
      "\n",
      "The late boomers?those born between 1955 and 1964?will still be in their prime career and prime earnings ages. Some will be looking to upgrade their housing, again in the same local area. They will have fewer children living at home than did earlier generations at the same age?and therefore more freedom in their location decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some observers have expressed the hope that these huge boomer generations might be a source for central-city revival. But the hope seems unrealistic, given the current location of this “suburban generation.” With the exception of Hispanics, baby-boomers, now in the 35-54 age groups, are less likely to reside in the city than either today’s elderly or adults now in their 20s and early 30s.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, elderly growth patterns during the 1990s show that the “graying of the suburbs” is well under way. Of the 30 counties with fastest-gaining elderly populations over the 1990s, most are either in nonmetropolitan areas or in middle or outer suburban counties of fast-growing metropolitan areas. Much of this simply reflects the aging-in-place of elderly who have moved to these fast-growing metropolitan areas during their lifetimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The projected gains in elderly over the next 25 years will occur in the Mostly White Fast-Growing and White-Black Fast-Growing areas discussed earlier. While some of this growth will be attributable to retirement migration to high amenity areas of the Mountain West and South, most will result from the aging-in-place of boomers who relocated there during their working lives or at least before retirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "This suggests somewhat different patterns of growth for the new immigrant minorities than for largely white or white and black baby-boomers. Much of the boomer growth and, hence, the projected elderly gains will be in the suburbs of major metropolitan areas and in regions of the country that are not capturing new immigrant minorities. Within metropolitan areas the better-off and healthy “yuppie elderly” will tend to locate on the periphery, and the more disadvantaged segments of the older population will reside closer in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Central cities and inner suburbs in metropolitan regions that have suffered economic and demographic declines in recent decades will continue to house disproportionate numbers of the nation’s disadvantaged elderly?older elderly people, widows and widowers, female-headed households, those with incomes below or near the poverty level and relatively high levels of disability. As they continue to age in place, they will pose special challenges for local institutions that are often the most financially strapped.\n",
      "\n",
      "But although the aging of the baby-boomers will have different effects for cities and suburbs, dealing with the social services, health care, and transportation needs of a faster-growing senior population will prove a challenge to cities and suburbs alike.\n",
      "New Forces at Work\n",
      "The advent of new immigrants and the aging of the baby-boomers will surely complicate both urban and suburban race-ethnic and aging demographic dynamics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The demographics of Los Angeles provide just one example of how the two countervailing trends could operate. As a result of the successive outmigration of whites, juxtaposed with the continued waves of immigration of new ethnic minorities, Los Angeles County’s elderly population is still majority white, its working-aged population is only about one-third white, and its child population is predominantly Hispanic and other racial and ethnic groups. Reflecting their age, the growing racial and ethnic groups in Los Angeles will be concerned with issues of affordable housing, good schools, and neighborhoods conducive to the raising of children. And, reflecting their age, whites are likely to be more concerned with health and social support services for an aging dependent population. Whether the same kind of “racial generation gap” will occur in other melting pot metropolitan areas remains to be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever else the new urban population profiles show, the old models of dealing with cities and suburbs will need to be revised to adapt to new demographic forces in America today.\n",

You’ve worked hard for the past couple years, earning credits and paying a lot less in tuition than you would have if you had enrolled immediately in a four-year college or university. But now you want to transfer, so that you can complete your bachelor’s degree. How do you figure out where to go? Ideally you’d probably like to find a college that would take most of your credits, where you’re likely to graduate from, and where the degree is going to count for something in the labor market. A college advisor could probably help you figure this out, but at many community colleges there are at least 1,000 other students assigned to your advisor, so you might have a hard time getting a quality meeting.  Some states have articulation agreements between two- and four-year institutions that guarantee admission for students who complete certain course sequences and perform at a high enough level. But these agreements are often dense and inaccessible. \n",
      "The combination of big data and behavioral insights has the potential to help students navigate these complex decisions and successfully follow through on their intentions. Big data analytic techniques allow us to identify concrete transfer pathways where students are positioned to succeed; behavioral insights ensure we communicate these options in a way that maximizes students’ engagement and responsiveness. \n",
      "The transfer decision is of course only one of many such challenges students and families face in education, where information to help people make informed choices is theoretically available, but often complex and poorly communicated. Parents of toddlers in many states can now access early childcare rating information through Quality Rating Improvement Systems, but in most locations these systems have low visibility. High school students in many schools have a range of courses available to them, but they may not get sufficient counseling on which course sequences best position them for postsecondary education. \n",
      "A growing body of innovative research has demonstrated that, by applying behavioral science insights to the way we communicate with students and families about the opportunities and resources available to them, we can help people navigate these complex decisions and experience better outcomes as a result. A combination of simplified information, reminders, and access to assistance have improved achievement and attainment up and down the education pipeline, nudging parents to practice early-literacy activities with their kids or check in with their high schoolers about missed assignments, and encouraging students to renew their financial aid for college. \n",
      "Big data analytic techniques have the potential to contribute to a next generation of behavioral science interventions in education—strategies that help people overcome complex matching problems like the transfer decision by giving personalized information about educational pathways that both build on the students’ prior experience and best position them for future success. Think of this as Netflix’s movie recommendation algorithm applied to education. There have already been some initial ventures in this direction. In one seminal study, researchers capitalized on student-level academic achievement data from the College Board and publicly-available data on college characteristics to send high-achieving, low-income students semi-customized packets of high-quality colleges and universities where students had a good chance of being admitted based on their academic performance. But there’s also real potential for much greater personalization. \n",
      "Take a community college student’s transfer decision as an example. Working with a state higher education system, researchers and data scientists could use a combination of articulation agreements and data from prior cohorts of students to identify optimal transfer pathways for different student groups and course-taking histories. Using data on current students’ course-taking experiences and contact information they provide to their college, the system could proactively send students messages that identifies specific institutions where they have already met the transfer requirements, or where they are on track to do so, and where prior cohorts of students from their same college have been successful upon transferring. Behavioral scientists can help design this outreach in a way that maximizes student engagement and responsiveness.  \n",
      "These types of big data techniques are already being used in some education sectors. For instance, a growing number of colleges use predictive analytics to identify struggling students who need additional assistance, so faculty and administrators can intervene before the student drops out. But frequently there is insufficient attention, once the results of these predictive analyses are in hand, about how to communicate the information in a way that is likely to lead to behavior change among students or educators. And much of the predictive analytics work has been on the side of plugging leaks in the pipeline (e.g. preventing drop-outs from higher education), rather than on the side of proactively sending students and families personalized information about educational and career pathways where they are likely to flourish. \n",
      "From pre-K through college, students and families have to navigate one complex decision after another—about which schools to attend, what courses to take, which programs to apply for. These decisions are particularly daunting for socioeconomically-disadvantaged families who have less experience navigating complicated educational decisions and less access to professional advising. Families like these also have to devote a substantial portion of their cognitive bandwidth to just making ends meet financially. By leveraging big data techniques and behavioral science insights, we can help families identify educational opportunities that position them for ongoing success. \n",

      "Yet India is playing catch-up in these vital areas. It devotes only 0.6 percent of GDP to R&D, well below the 2.74 percent in the United States and 2.07 in China.[5] Its limited investment has slowed innovation and put the country at an economic disadvantage. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that worldwide, AI will “increase global GDP by $15.7 trillion, a full 14%, by 2030.” But of this, $7 trillion is likely to accrue to China, $3.7 trillion to North America, and only $957 billion to India.[6]\n",
      "In the last three years, India has attracted less than $100 million in AI-oriented venture capital financing.[7] According to writer Ananya Bhattacharya, “the sector is dominated by American firms like Accenture, Microsoft, and Adobe, which have their innovation centres here [in India]. Home-grown efforts on the academic, business, and investor fronts are few.”[8] Seventy percent of the AI research in the nation occurs in non-Indian firms. As an illustration, in looking at research publications, 62 percent of it comes from Google and IBM employees working in India and “there is only one Indian company in the top 10.”[9]\n",
      "There is growing AI interest, however, as India starts to invest additional resources and deploy new AI applications. This year, the national government has doubled its investment in its innovation program known as Digital India to Rs3,063 crore (or $477 million) in order to fund advances in AI, machine learning, and 3-D printing.[10] The Ministry of Commerce and Industry has developed an AI Taskforce to develop policies that encourage innovation in these areas. Its recent report emphasized the need for greater investment, more AI research, revamping of school curricula, and additional innovation by the private sector.[11]\n",

      "“large financial bodies such as payment regulators handle billions of transactions each day across different channels such as ATM withdrawals, credit card payments, and e-commerce transactions. Advanced analytical techniques and ML [machine learning] algorithms, combined with human expertise allow institutions to flag transactions as potentially fraudulent at the time of occurrence and hence contain the damage as early as possible.”[12]\n",
      "These become particularly relevant given the recent discoveries of major fraudulent transactions in several large public and private sector banks in India. AI and ML techniques can be employed to create early warning systems and minimize human errors.\n",
      "Healthcare\n",
      "Advanced software helps health providers assess symptoms, diagnose disease, and plan appropriate treatments. According to writer Prakash Mallya, “the healthcare industry is relying on AI to fine-tune the accuracy of medical predictions and choose a fitting line of treatment.”[13] AI is a way to improve the quality of care while also containing medical costs. Beyond diagnosis and treatment, AI techniques and ML algorithms can also fine-tune interventions in public health policy across the country. There are large variations in the disease burden and demand for care across states of India, as well as across districts within large states such as Uttar Pradesh. The government can design real-time health interventions targeting specific populations, which is critically needed in Indian health policy.\n",

      "AI offers the hope of improving supply chain management and resource utilization. Both of these factors are vital for manufacturing and movement up the value chain. Factories and warehouses have difficulty managing logistics and forecasting the need for particular products. Software can help track supplies and make sure companies have what they need to make their products.[14] This is particularly important given the long term strategic role of the manufacturing sector for job creation and raising overall productivity in the economy.\n",
      "Crime Prediction\n",
      "Indian authorities are using AI developed abroad to anticipate crime and intervene before it happens. For example, an Israeli company called Cortica is working with the Best Group “to analyze the terabytes of data streaming from CCTV cameras in public areas. One of the goals is to improve safety in public places, such as city streets, bus stops, and train stations.” The firm is “looking for ‘behavioral anomalies’’ that signal someone is about to commit a violent crime.”[15] Given the various security risks that India faces, application of AI and ML can be instrumental in maintaining law and order as well as neutralizing extremist threats across states of the country.\n",
      "Precision Agriculture\n",
      "Farmers are seeking to deploy AI to increase crop yields. Using sensors that measure soil temperature and moisture, these software systems identify the ideal time for planting and harvesting, and help farmers make efficient use of pest control and fertilization. Suhas Wani, Director of the International Crop Research Institute notes “sowing date as such is very critical to ensure that farmers harvest a good crop. And if it fails, it results in loss as a lot of costs are incurred for seeds, as well as the fertilizer applications.”[16] The usage of AI is also potentially significant in weather insurance, where accurate estimates of local weather conditions are instrumental in designing insurance policies for agriculture and other industries.\n",
      "Based on these examples, it is clear India needs to encourage greater AI investment, see more support from government agencies, make it possible for private firms to develop novel applications, reform education programs in order to generate better AI training, and encourage the venture capital community to invest in India. Adoption of these actions would help India expand its GDP and build greater economic prosperity in the future.\n",

      "Data analytics tools have the potential to transform health care in many different ways. In the near future, routine doctor’s visits may be replaced by regularly monitoring one’s health status and remote consultations. The inpatient setting will be improved by more sophisticated quality metrics drawn from an ecosystem of interconnected digital health tools. The care patients receive may be decided in consultation with decision support software that is informed not only by expert judgments but also by algorithms that draw on information from patients around the world, some of whom will differ from the “typical” patient. Support may be customized for an individual’s personal genetic information, and doctors and nurses will be skilled interpreters of advanced ways to diagnose, track, and treat illnesses. In a number of different ways, policymakers are likely to have new tools that provide valuable insights into complicated health, treatment, and spending trends.\n",

      "However, recent developments in data analytics also suggest barriers to change that might be more substantial in the health care field than in other parts of the economy. Despite the immense promise of health analytics, the industry lags behind other major sectors in taking advantage of cutting-edge tools. Most health care organizations, for example, have yet to devise a clear approach for integrating data analytics into their regular operations. One study even showed that 56 percent of hospitals have no strategies for data governance or analytics.\n",
      "Compared to other industries, the slow pace of innovation reflects challenges that are unique to health care in implementing and applying “big data” tools. These barriers include the nature of health care decisions, problematic data conventions, institutionalized practices in care delivery, and the misaligned incentives of various actors in the industry. To address these barriers, federal policy should emphasize interoperability of health data and prioritize payment reforms that will encourage providers to develop data analytics capabilities.\n",
      "Despite the immense promise of health analytics, the industry lags behind other major sectors in taking advantage of cutting-edge tools.\n",
      "Sensitivity of care decisions\n",
      "A major barrier to the widespread application of data analytics in health care is the nature of the decisions and the data themselves. Unlike many other industries, health care decisions deal with hugely sensitive information, require timely information and action, and sometimes have life or death consequences. Each of these features creates a barrier to the pervasive use of data analytics.\n",
      "The immediacy of health care decisions requires regular monitoring of data and extensive staffing and infrastructure to collect and tabulate information. The nature of health care decisions are more immediate and intrinsic than those made in other settings, creating a hesitancy about overhauling any major aspect of care provision. Health care decisions must take into account patient preferences, which at times differ from expert recommendations.\n",

      "The importance and complexity of these decisions means physicians and patients insist on very high standards for data-analytics tools in health care. That has proven very challenging to designers of these tools, as health providers are more accustomed to dealing with either broad knowledge or narrow choices rather than complex predictions that require careful identification of decisions and calibration of predictions. As a result, clinical decision support software has struggled to make better insights than physicians. Even one of the most advanced systems, IBM’s Watson, made a series of “unsafe and incorrect treatment recommendations” because it was calibrated based on synthetic cases rather than real patient data. There is risk even when training software uses real patient data because decision support software may overfit its models and thereby make less useful suggestions, such as prescribing an inappropriate treatment plan. Sometimes, the clinically best medical decision is not always what a patient wants to pursue.\n",
      "The sensitive nature of health care decisions and data furthermore creates major concerns about privacy. Patients are rightfully concerned about the security of their data and concerned about it being used in ways that are detrimental to them, damage their reputations, or disadvantage them in the rating and marketing decisions of insurers. This isn’t limited to medical record data. Recent news coverage of the capture of the Golden State Killer, for example, has raised new questions about the privacy of direct-to-consumer genetic testing. And while the growth of “wearables” such as FitBit and Nike+ FuelBand have made health status monitoring accessible to patients, these data are not subjected to federal patient privacy laws, allowing these companies to design their own internal privacy policies and share information with third-parties.\n",
      "Problematic data conventions\n",
      "Several data conventions in health care hinder the widespread use of data analytics. Currently, health care data are split among different entities and have different formats such that building an insightful, granular database is next to impossible. These qualities greatly increase the cost of using data to provide value, even when all the relevant information has been recorded in some form. Furthermore, even well-structured data are often not available to researchers or providers who could use them in useful ways.\n",
      "Several data conventions in health care hinder the widespread use of data analytics. Currently, health care data are split among different entities and have different formats such that building an insightful, granular database is next to impossible.\n",
      "In general, the health care industry has been resistant to making information available as open data commons, which are up-to-date data provided in accessible format and available to all. That resistance comes in part from fear of violating privacy, even though existing strategies for protecting confidentiality greatly mitigate that risk. A larger reason is that data commons are a public good and will naturally be undersupplied by the market. A third data challenge is data quality. For analysis or predictions to have any value, they must be based on good data. One of the most hyped applications of big data in epidemiology, Google Flu Trends, turned out to underperform far more basic models, despite analyzing far more data, because its analysts were extrapolating from the behavior of Google users—an unrepresentative group of people. The experience illustrated that the success of data analytics in health care is dependent upon the availability and utilization of quality data.\n",
      "Institutional practices\n",
      "Entrenched practices in the delivery of health care also create several barriers to the full adoption of data analytics. One clear illustration of the challenge is in one of the most promising areas of data analytics: clinical decision support. While data analytics could greatly improve the clinical decision-making process, the development of decision support tools hasn’t paid sufficient attention to how decisions are actually made and the related workflows supporting those decisions. The tools often assume that putting the right information on a single person’s dashboard can induce them to make the right decision, but in reality, most difficult clinical decisions involve many actors and often follow institutional guidelines designed by committees. Data tools that do not fit into existing work and decision-making structures add burdens to physicians and are much less effective than they could be. For example, many attempts to bring data analytics or other information technology into health care have created a large data entry burden for physicians. This had led to high-profile mistakes, physician burnout, and general dissatisfaction with the tools.\n",
      "As a consequence, most of the major reasons physicians cite for their resistance to adoption of new data tools are related to workflow disruption. For data analytics to truly transform care, the designers of tools need to cognizant of the context their tools will be used in and health care organizations must be willing to reorganize some elements of their practice to empower patients and providers to use data-driven care.\n",
      "Misaligned incentives\n",
      "Arguably the largest barrier to the implementation and application of data analytics in health care is the splintered landscape of the industry, with separate components having their own incentives that diverge from what might be best for the entire system. At the moment, physicians or delivery systems may not know that their patients have visited emergency rooms, for example, unless told by the insurer—because claims data are held by the payer. Meanwhile, care providers may hold clinical data that could help insurers better manage their patient’s costs. The responsibility for managing any given patient is split between their insurer and various providers, each with different incentives and needs and neither functioning as an ideal agent for the patient.\n",
      "Insurers have incentives to invest in better health for their covered population, but these incentives are mitigated by annual contracts with employers or individuals and employee turnover, which moves many enrollees to a different insurer before the payer’s investments in their health pay off. There are also serious concerns with expecting insurers to take the lead on data analytics in health care. First, data tools designed for insurers are likely to center on costs, which may leave some quality-enhancing insights unexplored. Second, insurer data analytics may impose an externality on hospitals and physicians, which have to bear the administrative costs of complying with the data practices of various insurers. Third, insurers may not conduct their data analytics on a clinically useful timetable. Unless they feed data to providers continuously, it may not be timely enough to affect how patients receive care. The limited degree to which insurers provide claims data to providers that they contract with may reflect the expense of doing so, limitations in their legacy IT systems, or a desire to retain more of the care management responsibility.\n",
      "The responsibility for managing any given patient is split between their insurer and various providers, each with different incentives and needs and neither functioning as an ideal agent for the patient.\n",
      "Health care providers have their own particular incentives. Under the most common payment schemes, providers typically have little incentive to control patient costs. However, they likely do care about quality of care, even if they are hesitant to change their institutional practices and norms. Despite seeming like a more logical locus for data decisions, hospitals are often unwilling to undertake the costs of developing data capabilities or the disruption of implementing their use into regular practice. Hospitals also have an incentive to slow health information exchange standards because the lack of interoperability binds physicians into referral patterns favorable to them. Similarly, vendors of health information technology often don’t want standardization of data tools and practices because differentiation of their products and high costs for providers that switch vendors create substantial monopoly power for vendors. Finally, patients themselves often don’t support data practices that can improve care for all. The fear of data breaches or misuse leads patients to oppose data sharing arrangements that may have widespread positive externalities. In short, no individual actor in the health care space has the incentives or means to fully embrace the most revolutionary data analytics practices.\n",
      "Policy recommendations\n",
      "Because of the systemic challenges described above, we need policy changes that diminish the barriers to health analytics. While there is potential for radical overhaul, the initial priority should be making sure all hospitals can record, use, and share patient data in useful ways. One critical component of that agenda is ensuring interoperability of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). Federal policy has contributed a great deal to the adoption of EMRs and other health IT practices through incentives under the Medicare program, but providers still struggle with sharing that data. As discussed above, neither hospitals nor EMR vendors have a strong incentive to standardize health information exchanges, despite the fact that interoperable EMRs can improve care and save money. The 2009 Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act included health information exchange as one of the required capabilities for certified EMR systems. However, this requirement was included at a later implementation stage, allowing EMR systems to be designed and integrated into health systems without these capabilities, making interoperability even more difficult. In 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act increased incentives and penalties specifically promoting EMR interoperability.\n",
      "These incentives need not aim to establish one universal EMR. Applications that can access and transfer health data from different kinds of EMRs can achieve interoperability, but they are not used as widely or thoroughly as possible, risking a situation where the applications meant to bridge different EMRs themselves fail to adopt uniform data conventions. Federal policy could standardize the way EMR data are accessed and transferred by applications, like Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), that exist to facilitate interoperability. It could also revise HITECH and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to allow fees for data exchange, thus creating incentives to improve data exchange that could potentially counteract the existing disincentives. Federal support for best practices in data management and use would go a long way in helping the industry develop its own capabilities.\n",
      "The federal government can also indirectly support the development of health data analytics by continuing to encourage payment based on the value of care, typically through the Medicare program, encouraging alternative payment approaches, and by working to align quality measures and payment approaches with private insurers. Under value-based care models, providers are typically paid some amount per beneficiary based on the package of care they are expected to deliver, with payment at least partially tied to quality-of-care metrics. These models aim to create the incentive for providers to provide high-quality care at lower costs, which often involves closer coordination of care and careful revision of many practices. All these features make hospitals operating under value-based care models better loci for data-backed decisions. Kaiser Permanente has demonstrated the power of a well-integrated data strategy aimed at managing costs and quality. Conversely, improved data analytics capabilities may be precisely what health care providers need to better coordinate and improve value of care. Medicare could improve the usability of its data for a wider audience with a varying degree of analytic capabilities to help more of these providers successfully implement these new health care models. Coupling these systemic health care reforms can allow them to complement each other and reduce administrative confusion.\n",
      "Federal support for best practices in data management and use would go a long way in helping the industry develop its own capabilities.\n",
      "One factor that is holding back progress toward value-based payment is risk adjustment—varying the payment on the basis of how challenging one provider’s patients are in comparison to other providers. Much of the energy in improving risk adjustment has focused on contracts between purchasers and insurers—for example, between the Medicare program and Medicare Advantage plans. But the risk adjustment challenges for contracts between insurers and providers are distinct from these and, if ignored, pose grave challenges to some of the best providers, who inevitably attract patients with the most challenging conditions.\n",
      "Despite the disruptions to conventional practices, all actors in health care should be excited about the possibilities that new data tools will bring. But obtaining this enormous potential is not around the corner and will require overcoming challenges by all of the relevant components of the health care system.\n",

This new designation was part of a larger effort toward closing gender gaps around the globe, as outline in the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.

      "The definitive work on emerging technology and insurgency has yet to be written, but two recent books offer suggestions for how the era of big data and AI will affect the United States’ modern conflicts. Small Wars, Big Data: The Information Revolution in Modern Conflict, by Eli Berman, Joseph Felter, and Jacob Shapiro, offers few musings about the future of insurgency, but lays out a compelling theory about the ways in which information shapes insurgent violence. By contrast, Paul Scharre’s excellent new book, Army of None: Autonomous Weapons and the Future of War, offers little in the way of counterinsurgency strategy, but is wholly concerned with how artificial intelligence will reshape armed conflict. Taken together, they begin to sketch out a vision for how AI and big data might alter insurgent dynamics.\n",
      "The core insight of Small Wars, Big Data is that insurgencies are ultimately competitions over information rather than territory or ideology. Since insurgents can readily blend in with their surrounding populations, regime forces cannot defeat an insurgency unless the local population identifies who and where the insurgents are. The challenge for the state is thus to convince local civilians to provide that information, while the challenge for insurgents is to persuade them not to. In Berman, Felter, and Shapiro’s telling, just about everything that happens in an insurgency—from building schools and hospitals on the one hand, to the indiscriminate slaughter of civilians on the other—can be read as an attempt to coax or intimidate civilians into divulging or withholding what they know.\n",
      "Small Wars, Big Data is by no means the first to offer that argument. But it is unique in terms of the breadth and depth of the empirical evidence it marshals. From the pioneering research of Stathis Kalyvas in the early 2000s on, political scientists from Lisa Hultman to Laia Balcells have compiled an extraordinary body of empirical work on the “micro-foundations” of insurgent and civil war violence. As leading contributors to that literature themselves, the authors do an admirable job of surveying its findings.\n",
      "Of particular note is chapter four, which offers a thorough overview of the debate regarding the effects of developments in information technology on insurgent violence. As the authors note, on the one hand, information technology may reduce insurgent attacks by making it easier for states to gather intelligence about the insurgents. On the other, it may instead increase attacks by enabling insurgents to better coordinate with one another. By comparing the rollout of cell phone networks with insurgent violence in Iraq, the authors show that cell phones—by offering low cost, anonymous ways of supplying information about insurgents at little risk to the informant—do appear to reduce and disrupt insurgent activity. That the Taliban in Afghanistan and Boko Haram in Nigeria have both repeatedly targeted cell phone towers, despite the improved communication they enable, suggests that even insurgents themselves fear that information technology has tilted the balance of power to the state.\n",
      "For all its strengths, Small Wars, Big Data is not without its flaws. One is that it gives short shrift to the kind of “brute force” tactics that Jacqueline Hazelton discussed in a controversial article last summer. The book would have been stronger if it had discussed at greater length why exploiting information technology is more effective at defeating insurgencies than draconian policies like mass incarceration, mass resettlement, or even mass killing. But the other critique is that the book’s title hints at a topic it never addresses: It is primarily a book about the role of information in insurgency, rather than information technology. The title makes for great marketing, but it’s a bit of misnomer.\n",

      "Army of None, by contrast, more than lives up to its billing. Scharre has spent nearly a decade framing the early debate over autonomous weapons in D.C. and the Pentagon, and the experience shows. The book plainly and masterfully lays out the major questions that AI and autonomous weapons raise for the future of armed conflict. Although written for a popular audience, even well-informed academics will find it worthwhile as an introduction to the technical, ethical, and strategic issues that AI-infused weapons systems will introduce.\n",
      "Scharre’s argument about the coming ubiquity of big data and AI has profound implications for the future of insurgency. Very roughly, two futures are possible. In one, AI and autonomous weapons are both distributed and commoditized, such that insurgents can afford weapons systems that are nearly as capable as those of any given regime. Think of the commercial off-the-shelf drones that the Islamic State has deployed in Iraq and Syria, but with low-level intelligence and object-detection baked in via Tensorflow. Since many of the cutting-edge AI projects are open source and publicly available, it may well be possible to build makeshift lethal autonomous weapons systems that are nearly as good as state-of-the-art systems but at a fraction of the cost. In such a scenario, the balance may shift slightly to insurgents; one shudders to imagine the carnage a Mumbai-style attack could produce if the attackers had lethal drone swarms at their disposal.\n",
      "However, if the future of artificial intelligence is one that favors scale and centralization, then AI may give the upper hand to regime forces. In this world, regimes with access to the products and infrastructure of a great power, like the United States or China, may rapidly unravel insurgent networks. We might think of this as the “wars of none” scenario, since the regime’s overwhelming informational advantage may come to limit the need for violence altogether.\n",

      "Recall that the central point of Small Wars, Big Data is that insurgencies are primarily contests for information about the identity and location of insurgents, and that even relatively simple technology—such as a text-based tipline—appears to make it much easier for states to gain that information. What happens when tiplines are replaced with real-time surveillance systems equipped with facial recognition? As the cost of ubiquitous surveillance drops, we may see the emergence of a new counterinsurgency strategy: Whereas the “hearts-and-minds” approach tries to coax information out of civilians and the “brute force” approach attempts to coerce it, the “big brother” approach may bypass civilians altogether. There’s little need for informants if you have enough sensors, cameras, and processing power to recognize and track everyone, everywhere.\n",
      "Although such a scenario may seem far-fetched, early versions are already feasible. In the United States, Anduril Industries, the latest security startup funded by Peter Thiel, is fast at work building an “electronic” wall that has already proven remarkably effective at detecting and monitoring unauthorized border crossings in Texas. In China, meanwhile, authorities have responded to deadly attacks in Xinjiang by widely deploying facial recognition and mass surveillance technology there. And the capabilities of Chinese authorities are only set to grow: Beijing recently announced a massive new investment in SenseTime, an AI startup whose next generation product aims to identify objects and individuals across 100,000 live camera feeds simultaneously.\n",
      "Whether AI and information technology will empower states or insurgents remains unclear. Most likely it will do both, with AI and information technology supercharging insurgencies in failing or weak countries while constraining the space in which insurgency can occur everywhere else. What seems certain is that the information revolution is poised to revolutionize insurgency soon too.\n",

      "Two billion adults in the world are excluded from credit. The situation is especially bad for small farmers in rural areas who are unable to access loans to invest in their farms, trapped in a vicious circle of low productivity, low yields, and poor income. The Initiative for Smallholder Finance estimates that smallholders globally access just $50 billion of the $200 billion of lending that they require to grow their operations and improve their lives.\t\n",

      "The global growth of microfinance banks has created new opportunities for financial inclusion, with outstanding lending of $100 billion to around 200 million clients. Yet the majority of lending from microfinance institutions has been to urban populations and not to the rural poor or small farmers.\n",
      "Farmers with access to finance can invest in fertilizers and seeds to increase their yields and incomes potentially by more than 25 percent.\n",
      "There are well known reasons that make lending money to farmers so hard. Farmers are spread out across large thinly populated areas making them costly to reach and serve; they have few realizable assets to pledge as collateral against loans; and they generally have no financial history, which is needed for credit scoring. And on top of all that, agriculture is regarded as a risky business, often at the mercy of the weather. Yet farmers with access to finance can invest in fertilizers and seeds to increase their yields and incomes potentially by more than 25 percent.\n",
      "New technologies have the potential to give farmers access to the financial tools necessary for such growth.\n",
      "The rise of mobile phones in rural areas has been dramatic with over 90 percent of Africans able to access cellphone services, and many farmers now use cellphones to make calls, send text messages, and access data and informational services. The adoption of mobile money services has mirrored cellphone growth, allowing users to send and receive funds using a network of local agents.\n",

      "Big data analytics for credit risk assessment has been on the rise across urban areas of developing countries over the past years. Several startups offer loans to previously un-bankable customers using cellphone data (call data records, mobile money data, and social media data). This data is processed by algorithms, generating a predictive score of a person’s likelihood to repay a loan.\n",
      "Crop suitability mapping enables lenders to understand how risky a farmers production is, based on where they are located (using geo-mapping techniques, lenders are able to ensure that they only lend to a farmer growing a suitable crop in a suitable location).\n",
      "Can this new technology really make farmers bankable?\n",
      "Imagine a poor farmer in Ghana that has been growing beans to sell into the local market. After providing for her family, she doesn’t have enough money left over to purchase high quality seeds or fertilizers, even though such inputs would increase the amount of beans she will grow. She tried borrowing from the local microfinance bank, but since she had never saved with them before, they are not willing to grant her a loan. Suddenly she receives a text message asking if she’d like to apply for a loan to pay for inputs. She clicks “yes,” and receives an automated message saying she has received the loan. The loan automatically goes into her mobile money account, and she visits the supply store to purchase seeds and fertilizers. Next harvest she produces 30 percent more beans than usual. After selling her crops she visits the local mobile money agent to repay the loan and interest. As a result, she is left with more money than normal, so she joins the local microfinance bank to open a savings account with the surplus funds. Now, she is an individual with a bank account opening further opportunities for her and her family.\n",
      "The story above is not yet happening but is a distinct possibility and illustrates how technology can transform a farmer into a profitable borrower. While cellphone-based lending is starting to happen in Africa, with products such as MShwari in Kenya, this type of lending so far has been mainly for small, short-term loans for urban customers. Farmers who are less tech-savvy and need larger, longer-term loans repayable at the end of the season cannot benefit from existing mobile loan services. Yet by transforming the application process into a simple automated cellphone-based application, transaction costs plummet and remote farmers can access the service. By using cellphone records for credit scores, previously “un-scorable” customers are now ratable. Using agronomic geospatial data ensures that lending is only given to farmers growing the right crops in the right location. Migrating cash management to mobile money platforms dramatically reduces money disbursement and recovery costs. The mix of these technologies could grant access to seasonal lending to smallholder farmers.\n",
      "Perhaps the nearest example of this technological convergence to date is Safaricom’s DigiFarm and Connected Farmer model in Kenya. The platform offers a range of services to farmers including e-vouchers for quality inputs at discounted prices; access to agriculture advice services via a training module; and advice on how to appropriately use inputs like seed and fertilizer. Digifarm also offers farmers the opportunity to apply, via their cellphones, for a loan to be used to purchase agricultural inputs, although data on total lending and repayment rates is not yet available. The loan module appears to build upon their proven success with the M-Shwari mobile microloan available to Sarfaricom customers.\n",
      "If Digifarm and other similar services achieve success, we are likely to see many other mobile companies, banks, and startups replicate their models.  Most exciting of all is the impact that this will have on farmers who will have increased opportunities to invest in their endeavors.\n",

      "URL: Idea to retire: Viewing data as an output\n",
      "TITLE: \n",
      "It is rare to talk to federal administrators and not hear something about “data-driven decision making.” Administrators dedicate significant time and information technology resources to decisions about their agency’s viability and to defending their standing in appropriations discussions. However, the questions asked of the data by senior officials for these purposes are dramatically different than the questions asked by a front line case manager for a social service organization.  Unfortunately, it is the former that has the loudest voice in procurement and system design conversations.  The prevailing top-down approach to data collection and use also puts little actionable information in the hands of the people responsible for gathering data. As a result, the incentive to collect data is diminished while opportunities for informed program improvements and abilities to measure outcomes against costs are missed. A small shift in our approach to data collection and visualization could lead to big improvements in the effectiveness of social service delivery.\n",
      "While the effort to collect and analyze data gives the impression of transparency, we are actually looking at our institutions through a fun house mirror. Frameworks are geared toward only answering a small set of high-level questions, creating a false sense of openness that limits the policy discourse around those agencies to their funding—not their effectiveness. \n",
      "It is time for this “good on the surface” notion to die, and in its place we must re-orient our data collection strategies to inform our work as it happens. \n",
      "Make no mistake—for the vast majority of agencies this is a wholesale paradigm shift with significant implications for design, implementation, and evaluation of social service delivery.\n",
      "Collecting the wrong data\n",
      "Take the case of homelessness organizations. Social workers across the country bring homeless families into a network of wrap-around services available through several state and local agencies. With every meeting, they collect qualitative and quantitative data about clients and update the case management system that loosely connects to that network of providers. If effectively analyzed and visualized, this information would likely help spot warning signs of future trouble for the family and would give social workers a chance to make a meaningful early intervention.  Visualizing the data could also inform the network of providers of interventions that are working so they can put resources to the most effective programs.\n",
      "However, the data entered in the system is often not used to produce the types of insights needed to help best manage cases. Instead, the data is sent to analysts at The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) who, once a year, release large, static reports including the Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR), Annual Progress Report (APR), and HEARTH Performance Measures. HUD has strict guidelines and complex coding systems for how data can be entered, stored, and used by community service providers. The mandated once-yearly reports are the primary form of feedback case managers receive from the information they’ve entered and contain very little useful information for day-to-day client service. \n",
      "Where this backward looking systemic analysis is valued is among the policymakers making budgetary decisions. Forensic analysis of program effectiveness is usually measured along broad performance indicators like individuals served, cost-per-beneficiary, number of people who have exited from system dependence. But these reactive measures do very little to help social workers ensure that client families make progress and don’t slide back into poverty. Without that direct connection to their work, it is inevitable that data collection and analysis becomes an infrequent and low-value administrative task on top of an already large workload.\n",
      "Shifting mentalities\n",
      "As Andrew Means describes it, we need to “upgrade from an output mentality to an input plus output mentality” when it comes to using data in this context. Means, the founder of Data Analysts for Social Good and The Impact Lab, works with organizations to update data collection techniques and use data science to solve longstanding social problems. He argues that too many public institutions view data exclusively an output of a program to show whether or not the original design was effective. \n",

      "Instead, Means advocates for primarily viewing data as an input—information that establishes a baseline of understanding and makes predictive modeling possible alongside forensic analysis. He has seen how individuals who see a far greater value in the data are more likely collect data faithfully and accurately. Better data leads to better analysis helping inform programs, making more targeted, efficient, and effective program work is possible. \n",
      "Drawing on our previous example, using data as an input allows agencies to estimate which beneficiaries are most likely to drop out of a homeless support program or which program they would be best served by. This is clearly in an agency’s best interest. Not only is the agency able to focus human and financial resources where they are most effective, but overall improvements in outcomes will reflect positively in conventional budgetary discussions. \n",
      "Higher value data = better transparency\n",
      "This brings us back to the question of transparency and value. Data that is not valued is not rigorously collected or validated. Moreover, because the analysis is only interesting to a small group of administrators, reporting is an afterthought. That is why agencies often dump a 25 column, comma-delimited file with 10,000 rows of data on their website and assume they are meeting their disclosure obligations. This information is virtually inaccessible to the average person in that form. It exists to validate past decisions instead of informing future ones, and the by-product of that approach is a policy discourse that cannot leverage data to advance our service delivery beyond the status quo. \n",
      "For social workers, agency directors, and funders, the challenge is not to simply make the data available but to make it useful for everyone in the decision chain. By using contextual resources like data visualization, individuals are empowered to act and ask more, better questions of the data. For a social worker, this could be an opportunity to use data in their work with individuals or to coordinate with partners who provide additional services to clients. Further upstream, institutions have an opportunity to articulate their value, showcase their progress, and advocate for a broader understanding of issues critical to their work. \n",
      "Not only will this increase public understanding of key issues, but also increase the accountability of agencies and decision makers to their constituencies to the benefit of our broader society.\n",
      "By taking a grassroots approach to data system design, we can put analytical power back into the hands of the people who can most effectively use it for change. For example, the Community Technology Alliance partnered with our organization to put the HUD data discussed above into a series of interactive reports that will help homelessness agencies nationwide and give them an opportunity to combine that data with their proprietary data to draw out more valuable insights. Modeled as a nationwide Data Fellowship, the program trains a group of 20 homeless services data enthusiasts across the country on analytical tools and visualization best practices. In addition to building a first set of field-usable visualizations, the fellows will also train their peers on the value of collecting and using data in their work.\n",
      "This is not just an effort to tackle homelessness and create change within one social service organization’s reporting system. It is an effort to create a new standard for information utility and transparency that all organizations can follow based on a few simple principles:\n",
      "\n",
      "Data must be useful to those responsible for collecting it and acting on it.\n",
      "More useful data for local decision-makers means better data for federal and state funding agencies as well as taxpaying citizens\n",
      "Data and the story it tells must be accessible and easily understood at all levels\n",
      "\n",
      "This is our challenge to government information technology leaders—let the old output-only notion of data driven decision making die. Build systems from where the information is most valuable, easily understood, and actionable and let them yield better data. Encourage transparent institutions using better data, and enrich the public discussion about an agency’s value to society. \n",

      "When U.N. member states unanimously adopted the 2030 Agenda in 2015, the narrative around global development embraced a new paradigm of sustainability and inclusion—of planetary stewardship alongside economic progress, and inclusive distribution of income. This comprehensive agenda—merging social, economic and environmental dimensions of sustainability—is not supported by current modes of data collection and data analysis, so the report of the High-Level Panel on the post-2015 development agenda called for a “data revolution” to empower people through access to information.1\n",

      "Today, a central development problem is that high-quality, timely, accessible data are absent in most poor countries, where development needs are greatest. In a world of unequal distributions of income and wealth across space, age and class, gender and ethnic pay gaps, and environmental risks, data that provide only national averages conceal more than they reveal. This paper argues that spatial disaggregation and timeliness could permit a process of evidence-based policy making that monitors outcomes and adjusts actions in a feedback loop that can accelerate development through learning. Big data and artificial intelligence are key elements in such a process.\n",
      "Emerging technologies could lead to the next quantum leap in (i) how data is collected; (ii) how data is analyzed; and (iii) how analysis is used for policymaking and the achievement of better results. Big data platforms expand the toolkit for acquiring real-time information at a granular level, while machine learning permits pattern recognition across multiple layers of input. Together, these advances could make data more accessible, scalable, and finely tuned. In turn, the availability of real-time information can shorten the feedback loop between results monitoring, learning, and policy formulation or investment, accelerating the speed and scale at which development actors can implement change.\n",

      "Data collection: From surveys to satellites and sensors\n",
      "Traditionally, economists have relied on household consumption surveys and national account estimates to map patterns of poverty and to assess the impact of policy interventions, in particular, social assistance and social insurance programs. Conducting household surveys, however, is time-intensive, costly, and prone to error. In many countries, notably in the poorest countries and fragile states where development needs are greatest, survey data is simply unavailable. Between 2000 and 2010, 39 of 59 countries in Africa conducted fewer than two surveys, implying that no time trends could be reliably established.2 Even in those countries where more frequent household survey data is available, the quality is in doubt. For example, survey results vary considerably depending on the method used to identify consumption or income.\n",
      "Kathleen Beegle et al. (2012) found that recall methods, requiring that respondents recall consumption over a defined period, measure lower consumption than personal diaries, in which respondents track their consumption in real-time.3 Survey results are notoriously at odds with national income accounts estimates of personal consumption, with the gap amounting to 60 percent of the total in some countries, including large countries with relatively sophisticated statistical systems like India and Indonesia.4 Micro studies suggest that survey answers depend on the type of respondent, reference period, and degree of commodity detail, all of which can be difficult to control across organizations and projects, and which are often changed from survey to survey, complicating any analysis of what is happening over time. Furthermore, underreporting is frequent in illiterate homes and among urban respondents, which can lead to large data gaps among poorer households.5\n",
      "Big data from satellites, mobile phones, and social media, among other tools, allows researchers to build on, and in some cases, replace traditional methods of acquiring socioeconomic data. Its advantages are frequency and timeliness, accuracy and objectiveness. Its disadvantages are the fact that the indicators available are merely proxies for what policymakers are interested in and need for policy design.\n",
      "Remote sensing satellites\n",
      "Earth Observations (EO) provide finely tuned and near-real-time data on global terrain. These data are becoming widely available to public and private actors through platforms like the Global EO System of Systems (GEOSS). A coalition of 105 governments and 127 participating organizations, known as the Group on Earth Observations (GEO), is working to ensure that EO are accessible and interoperable.6 There is increasing recognition that these data can be used to support the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.78\n",
      "While satellite sensors have been widely adopted in the environmental science community to observe changes in weather, climate, and terrain, their application to economics is new. Researchers have found that high-resolution, spatially tuned satellite imagery can provide important insight into human economic activity. Because data is disaggregated to local levels, comparisons within and among countries are possible.9\n",
      "While satellite sensors have been widely adopted in the environmental science community to observe changes in weather, climate, and terrain, their application to economics is new.\n",
      "Social scientists have started to use nighttime light measures, or luminosity, as proxies for economic activity and population distribution. Satellites, like the U.S. Air Force Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System (OLS), can map artificial light in cities, towns, and industrial centers on the Earth’s surface. Now declassified, the raw data are publically available. Several researchers have noted a correlation between nighttime light measures and country-level or subnational economic output. In 1997, Christopher Elvidge et al. identified a correlation between illuminated areas, electric power consumption, and GDP at the country level.10 Paul C. Sutton and Robert Costanza (2002) examined luminosity and GDP per square kilometer, also finding a high correlation.11 Xi Chen and William Nordhaus (2011) compared luminosity measures with conventional measures of output to indicate the value-add in data-poor countries. More recently, J. Vernon Henderson et al. (2012) determined that nighttime lights were “uniquely suited to spatial analyses of economic activity” and could serve as a proxy for GDP growth on the subnational level.12\n",
      "The satellite imagery below shows NASA Earth Observatory nighttime light data from Syria. The left hand image shows a concentration of Syria’s economic activity in two corridors in 2012. A North-South corridor on the country’s Western border, stretching from Damascus in the lower left of the image to Aleppo in the upper-left corner. The second corridor is a diagonal linking Aleppo with Baghdad in the lower-right corner. Just four years later, in 2016, the satellite captured a far darker image reflecting the losses to Syria’s economy and infrastructure during the ongoing civil war. In particular, Aleppo is barely visible, and the road from there to Baghdad no longer supports any economic activity. The luminosity of Damascus and its environs is also sharply reduced.\n",

      "Syria is a case in point where conflict made it impossible to collect data through any means other than remote sensing. And, in fact, many countries are constrained by budget or conflict, making satellite imagery the only option from which to infer socioeconomic characteristics.\n",
      "There are limitations to this approach. Luminosity data is hard to interpret in low-output and high-output regions. In low-output regions, it is difficult to differentiate man-made lights from natural background lighting and reflections. In high-output regions, usually urban areas, the measure of bright lights may be capped by a saturation band, so that the metric is not smooth. Improvements in data quality to address these limitations are already happening and this will further open up the field to social scientists.\n",

      "Mobile phone data can also be used to infer socioeconomic characteristics in a geographically disaggregated way. Cell phones are ubiquitous in developed and emerging economies. Call Detail Records (CDRs), which are stored and secured by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) provide data on: (i) mobility, (ii) social interactions, and (iii) consumption and expenditure patterns (from the degree to which airtime is pre-paid). Joshua Blumenstock et al. (2015) used anonymized metadata from Rwanda’s largest cell phone network in combination with follow-up surveys to examine the extent to which mobile phone data can be used to estimate socioeconomic characteristics, and map a country-level wealth profile.13 When aggregated at a district level, Blumenstock et al. found that mobile phone data estimations were comparable to predictions using ground data collected by the Kigali Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). More granularly, historical records of an individual’s mobile phone use can accurately predict socioeconomic characteristics. Vanessa Frias-Martinez et al. determined that cell records can also be used to approximate costly and infrequent census information.14 They propose a new tool, CenCell, which uses behavioral patterns collected from CDRs to classify socioeconomic levels, with classification accuracy rates of up to 70 percent. The tool provides policymakers with affordable census maps at varying degrees of granularity. It should be noted that while CDRs provide detailed information on individual patterns of behavior, the data is proprietary and thus difficult to obtain. Additionally, questions over privacy and cybersecurity complicate efforts. Even when the data are available in the public domain, and individuals consent to its use for evaluation, some vulnerable populations may be underrepresented in mobile phone data.\n",
      "Digital footprints from social media can also fill gaps in data for policymakers and development practitioners. For example, Google Trends (GT) reports, which provide real-time information on search queries at state and metro levels for several countries, have informed private consumption predictions.15 Google analytics could have broad-reaching utility for other socioeconomic measures.\n",
      "Digital footprints from social media can also fill gaps in data for policymakers and development practitioners.\n",
      "Once relegated to sci-fi films, robotics have expanded opportunities to collect in situ data on environmental indicators. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and underwater smart devices allow researchers to explore uncharted areas of the ocean. Marine sensing technology provides real-time, multidimensional data on the sea surface and deep sea. UNESCO notes that it is now possible to incorporate marine sensors on submarine telecommunication cables at intervals of 50-70 km.16 These sensors could collect data on the seafloor and detect movement related to earthquakes or tsunamis. Above ground, a spinoff of Bivee Inc., Starling Data, has devised a unit that collects and transmits localized data in real-time without reliance on external power sources. Designed to improve data collection in developing economies, the unit tracks data on power quality, climate (rainfall, wind, humidity, etc.), and infrastructure (mapping, emissions), which it then uploads to the cloud. As the global community works in pursuit of economic progress joined with planetary stewardship, data on the environment will be increasingly important.\n",
      "Data analysis: From hypothesis testing to machine learning\n",
      "Machine learning (ML) allows researchers to analyze data in novel ways. Computers today can process multiple sets of data in little time and, with the correct classification sets, recognize highly complex patterns among them. Designed to simulate the interactions of biological neurons, “deep learning” uses artificial neural networks to discern features in successive layers of data while iterating on previously recognized trends. In the mid-1980s, artificial intelligence required that programmers classify data as part of the algorithms.17 Today, machines learn from and adapt to different inputs with little human supervision.\n",
      "Neal Jean et al. (2016) explain how this might work in the field of economic development.18 Using a combination of survey and satellite data from Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, and Rwanda, the Stanford team trained machines to recognize visual patterns that could then make predictions about socioeconomic distributions. Neal Jean et al. employed a particular type of machine learning, known as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to improve the accuracy of their forecasts. Here’s how it works: the CNN model pre-trains on ImageNet, a classification data set with over 1,000 different categories of labeled images, to discern visual features that appear in daytime satellite imagery. Next, programmers train the CNN to predict which features best explain the variance observed in nighttime light intensities. Finally, these daytime features are combined with cluster-level, geolocated socio-economic variables from survey data (such as USAID supported Demographic and Health Surveys) to build ridge regression models. The model parameters can then be used to extend forecasts to areas of the country not covered by the DHS, to get comprehensive national maps, such as poverty and mortality maps. Jean et al. determined that CNN estimates could accurately predict average household consumption and asset wealth in Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, and Rwanda. In addition, their model outperformed luminosity and mobile-phone only approaches.\n",
      "Applications of artificial intelligence, like the one detailed above, could have a sweeping impact on the development field. Training machines on multiple layers of input reduces inaccuracies while allowing researchers to include a rich variety of publically available variables by merging geocoded data sets with infrastructure variables and social indicators.\n",
      "Policymaking using data analysis and feedback loops\n",
      "There are a number of examples that illustrate the ways data analytics can inform global development. These include using satellite imagery to map schools, identifying the hidden costs of conflict and reconciliation, tracking illegal mining, and addressing rapid urbanization. We elaborate on these examples below.\n",
      "Employing satellite imagery to map schools in Kyrgyzstan\n",
      "The government of Kyrgyzstan previously relied on administrative data to evaluate school placement, determine expected volume of students, and allocate classroom resources. It has recently adopted a new program called “Taza Koom,” designed to increase access to 21st century skills in schools across the country. The program faced significant barriers. For example, as of March 2017, 40 percent of schools lacked access to basic internet services.19 UNICEF Kyrgyzstan teamed with the government to generate a highly detailed map of schools with real-time measures of connectivity, overlaid with additional sources of data that could serve as proxies for education efficiency. The hope is that this system will give national stakeholders the insights they need to address digital gaps in the school system.\n",
      "Kyrgyzstan’s school mapping project is part of a broader UNICEF Innovation initiative to map every school in the world. In collaboration with UC San Diego’s Big Pixel Initiative and Development Seed, UNICEF is developing a convolutional neural network to recognize patterns in satellite imagery that could be used to locate schools. UNICEF has joined traditional measures of data collection with crowdsourcing methods and remote sensing observations. To aid decision-making, the data will be available in real-time on an online platform.\n",
      "Identifying the hidden costs of conflict and reconciliation in Colombia \n",
      "Decades of conflict between the government of Colombia and the guerilla group Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) left large portions of the Colombian Amazon unexamined. Now that FARC guerilla fighters have vacated the forest, scientists are quickly working to document Colombia’s distinct ecosystem and biodiversity.20 Geoscientist Ruiz Carrascal is building a network of climate sensors that monitor temperature and humidity in alpine regions.21 Meanwhile, more than 40 researchers have kick-started a digital platform that collects and analyzes data on a wide range of environmental indicators, including species distribution, forest cover, and weather patterns.\n",

      "Fears of rapid urbanization give urgency to the effort to analyze Amazonian data. After FARC abandoned its strongholds, logging, cattle, and gold-mining industries expanded their operations into the forest. While this has brought much-welcomed economic growth to the region, it has also brought about rapid deforestation: post-peace accords, the rate has increased by 44 percent.22 The hope is that new in situ environmental sensors and machine learning techniques will generate models that can predict threats to conservation. This information could then inform policies to better protect forested areas and encourage both peace and sustainable development.\n",
      "Harnessing Earth observations to track illegal mining in Ghana\n",
      "Illegal mining is prevalent in Ghana. At least 30 cocoa farmers in the regions outside of Dunkwa, in Ghana’s Central region, have sold their plantations to gold miners, who quickly excavate the land.23 The cost of these often-illegal operations is high: in addition to supporting an illicit economy, gold mining contributes to deforestation and water contamination. While the government of Ghana works to balance the economic benefits of small-scale gold mining alongside environmental conservation, getting the balance right is proving difficult. The Small-Scale Gold Mining Act of 1989 permitted groups of nine or fewer to mine for gold. An updated law from 2006 requires that miners obtain licenses from the Ghanaian Environmental Protection Agency and Forest Commission, but enforcement of these regulations is difficult.\n",
      "Data from the Africa Regional Data Cube (ARDC) could help policymakers identify topographic changes and track illegal mining operations.24 The ARDC collects EO data, including 17 years of satellite imagery archives, on Kenya, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and Ghana. It combines 8,000 visual layers across a defined period of time to produce localized, easily accessible data. The ARDC’s ability to compare changes in land across many years in Ghana could help policymakers identify and enforce regulation of extractive industries.\n",
      "Addressing rapid urbanization in Sierra Leone through high-resolution poverty mapping\n",
      "Rapid urbanization in Sierra Leone has contributed to major inequities. As of 2015, 40 percent of the national population lives in urban areas.25 Of that, 50 percent lives in the Western Region, where Freetown is located, compared to 10 percent in the Southern Region.26 Due to rapid population growth in Freetown, affordable land and housing are in short supply. Estimates place the housing deficit at 166,000 units.27 Land degradation has further complicated efforts to improve the situation. Sierra Leones’s Environmental Protection Agency warns that deforestation associated with unplanned dwellings and the rise of informal settlements is leading to soil erosion, among other environmental issues. In 2017, flooding killed upward of 400 people and contributed to rising homelessness.\n",
      "The Africa Regional Data Cube could help policymakers track rapid urbanization in Sierra Leone.28 High-resolution satellite imagery of land cover and human settlements may aid efforts to identify vulnerable populations and improve city planning.29 GRID3—a project led by the United Nations Population Fund, U.K. Department for International Development, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, WorldPOP/Flowminder, and Columbia University’s Center for International Earth Science Information Network—also aims to build robust geospatial data for population mapping, among other policy priorities. GRID3 is already being used in Nigeria to identify and collect data on settlements across the country to improve public health responses (starting with polio eradication) and it could be used in a similar way to deliver better policy outcomes in other countries.\n",
      "Remote sensing can aid efforts to calculate the number of individuals living in poverty, and determine where they are located. This could have far-reaching advantages for the development community.\n",
      "In fact, subnational mapping of population distributions and wealth profiles is already garnering attention within the academic community. Christopher Elvidge et al. (2009) produced the first satellite-generated, spatially disaggregated global map of poverty.30 He and his team used four types of remote sensor data—DMSP lights, MODIS land cover, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) topography, and National Geospatial Intelligence Agency’s Controlled Image Base (CIB) —calibrated with 2006 World Development Indicators national poverty levels to estimate the number of people living in poverty. Their estimates show that remote sensing can aid efforts to calculate the number of individuals living in poverty, and determine where they are located. This could have far-reaching advantages for the development community.\n",
      "Recommendations for action\n",
      "Social science is just beginning to exploit big data and machine learning. In each area—data collection, data analysis, and policymaker use of analysis—there is scope for improvements. There are a number of actions that would improve access to big data, improve the use of data analytics, and use machine learning to monitor outcomes and drive policymaking.\n",
      "Improve access to and cost of big data.\n",
      "Data is expensive and, increasingly, is held within private companies. Researchers must negotiate access to data such as Call Detail Records on a case-by-case basis. However, the telecommunications companies that currently collect these data are concerned about privacy issues (although researchers typically ask for aggregated data) and are reluctant to give away for free data that they could potentially sell.\n",
      "Granted, generating data is expensive, so a core challenge will be funding. High-quality satellite machinery is expensive and requires ongoing maintenance. The Department of the Navy and Department of the Air Force spent a combined $29.8 million in FY15 to acquire and process data from the Department of Defense’s Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) and other sources of SBEM data.31\n",
      "To implement this recommendation, two things are needed. First, a set of ethically based protocols for provision of mobile data, along with an agreement with companies that they provide public access to such data as a condition of their license to operate. Second, governments, especially rich country governments with satellites, should provide access to the imagery for free or at marginal cost (which, given the digital technology involved, is almost free).\n",
      "Improve big data analytics.\n",
      "Data providers are often surprised that remote sensing data is being used for social science purposes. Their primary audience is in the military and intelligence services and the data tend to be mostly classified. However, this restricts data availability and timeliness in a way that compromises machine learning. Robust classification sets are needed to train the artificial neural networks. Additionally, machines require some degree of human supervision. Many of the countries that most need data analysis do not have the statistical infrastructure, nor do they have sufficient numbers of trained personnel, to employ “deep learning” techniques.\n",
      "To implement this suggestion, data providers should work with analysts to understand better what kinds of data would enable better machine learning.\n",
      "Use machine learning to monitor outcomes and drive policymaking, with particular attention to spatial implications. \n",
      "Policymakers in economic development are largely unfamiliar with big data and its potential benefits, especially in identifying spatial issues. Development projects and interventions are over-designed at the beginning, with long gestation periods to try to overcome potential obstacles and bottlenecks. As a result, despite significant investment in monitoring and evaluation, the time frames involved are very long: decades from project concept to completion, followed by more years in evaluation and development of new approaches.\n",
      "Machine learning offers an opportunity to shortcut this process, but policymakers have not yet systematically built into project design feedback loops that would permit rapid fine-tuning, while projects are being implemented. Results-based approaches require a mindset change: away from evaluating results and toward constantly learning to scale up and improve results. Such a mindset change will require very different project designs.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Emerging technologies have transformed three core areas: (i) data collection; (ii) data analysis and (iii) use of data analysis for policymaking. New big data platforms allow researchers to acquire granular details on a number of socioeconomic and environmental indicators. Remote sensing satellites provide real-time luminosity and daytime pictures that can serve as proxies for human economic activity, as well as determine changes to land cover and urban features. Other sources of geospatial data—like Call Detail Records, social media footprints, automated marine sensors, and climate-measuring devices—expand the scope and volume of information available to policymakers. Meanwhile, advances in data analytics transform the way in which data scientists and machines manipulate large sets of data. Artificial neural networks make it possible to recognize patterns across multiple layers of input, improving accuracy and permitting multidimensional analyses. Policymakers have used this information to map digital connectivity across schools in Kyrgyzstan, assess deforestation in Colombia following the peace process, track illegal mining operations in Ghana, and improve city planning in the Western Region of Sierra Leone, to name a few examples. Agenda 2030 has at its disposal a new digital toolkit that is spearheading a data revolution.\n",
      "Conventional methods of data collection, which require substantial time to conduct and disseminate, have hindered efforts to implement change quickly and effectively.\n",
      "The global community is entering a new world, where real-time data is shortening the feedback loop between outcomes and policy. Conventional methods of data collection, which require substantial time to conduct and disseminate, have hindered efforts to implement change quickly and effectively. By the time reports are available to key decision-makers, data on the ground have already changed. In contrast, big data and artificial intelligence allow researchers to acquire up-to-date information at varying degrees of granularity, while simultaneously processing for patterns that can inform policy.\n",
      "The key to this data revolution is trust. How can the development community foster trust among individuals, whose socioeconomic data are critical to achieving sustainable solutions, at a time when concerns are mounting over privacy and cybersecurity? Relatedly, how can researchers assure policymakers that machine-generated analyses can be trusted as evidence on which to base key policy decisions?\n",
      "While emerging technologies bring about a number of technical solutions, transformation will be felt most acutely in our ability to learn and adapt alongside the machines. After all, artificial intelligence is not a panacea. Only when machine learning is coupled with human insight will the global community achieve sustainable development solutions.\n",

      "Learning progressions have been described as roadmaps that help align curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment. These roadmaps point out important locations on the typical journey from novice to expert by describing what someone at each important location on the roadmap knows and can do. The descriptions highlight what is unique about each location, ensuring that differences between locations are emphasized so the transformations in skills and knowledge along the learning journey can be recognized. By mapping the journey, learning progressions help ensure the curriculum developers, teachers, and assessment designers are all working with the same destination in mind.\n",
      "Increasingly, learning progressions are being used both to construct assessment tools that will reflect the learning pathway, as well as to locate how students are meeting learning goals. Focussing on these two parallel functions can be useful to central education systems in evaluating new curricula.\t\n",

      "Different types of curriculum design require learning progressions of different grain sizes. When developing multi-year curricula, designers require coarse-grained learning progressions which describe learning over a long time period. An example from the USA illustrates how levels on a learning progression in science can be mapped to two or three grades each so the curriculum can be designed accordingly. This approach provides the opportunity to design evidence-based curricula which mirror the typical patterns of development for learners across grades because the learning progressions are founded on research.\n",
      "In the Philippines, we have applied this approach through fine-grained learning progressions that are being used to monitor student progress through the new science curriculum for Grades 7-10. The curriculum presents increasing levels of complexity from one grade to another in an upward spiraling progression, to develop deep understandings of core science concepts and skills. This provides the opportunity to construct tests that reflect this progression, and the test results can be used in multiple ways.\n",
      "We wanted to know whether students entering a grade had the pre-requisite knowledge, skills, and understanding needed to be able to engage successfully with the science chemistry curriculum at that grade level. To develop the tests used in this research, and with the support of the Philippines Department of Education, the Assessment Curriculum and Technology Research Centre (ACTRC) collaborated with colleagues from University of the Philippines National Institute for Science and Mathematics Education Development (UP NISMED), University of Philippines College of Education, and its Integrated School to audit the curriculum and identify the prerequisite conceptual knowledge and skills that are necessary for students to engage with the chemistry content in each of Grades 7-10. Using the audit information, test items were written to assess mastery of the identified concepts and skills.\n",
      "As students entered into each of the grade levels, they took the grade-appropriate test, which provided information about their readiness to engage with the curriculum. The results, aligned with the progressions, captured the levels of proficiency of students within each successive grade. Some students were still at early locations along the learning journey, while others had progressed further and employed more sophisticated chemical thinking. The levels on each learning progression were then compared to the pre-requisite skills and knowledge expected by the grade level curriculum and the percentage of students who are ready (and not ready) for the curriculum content were calculated.\n",

From the expert identification of what level of skill is required to enable students to engage successfully with the Grade 8 chemistry curriculum, students in Level C and above were found to be ready for the Grade 8 curriculum, while students in Level B and below were found to be unready. The differences between the knowledge and skills at Level B and Level C included the crucial distinction between representations of matter where differences can be seen by the naked eye and representations of matter where differences cannot be seen even with a microscope and must be understood conceptually. The results suggest that this fundamental change in how scientific knowledge is represented is one for which many of the students were unprepared when entering Grade 8 chemistry.\n",

      "What is a “smart” society? While flights of imagination from science-fiction writers, filmmakers, and techno-futurists involve things like flying cars and teleportation, in practice smart technology is making inroads in a piecemeal fashion, often in rather banal circumstances. In Chicago, for example, predictive analytics is improving health inspections schedules in restaurants, while in Boston city officials are collaborating with Waze, the traffic navigation app company, combining its data with inputs from street cameras and sensors to improve road conditions across the city. A city-state such as Singapore has a more holistic idea of a “smart nation,” where the vision includes initiatives from self-driving vehicles to cashless and contactless payments, robotics and assistive technologies, data-empowered urban environments, and technology-enabled homes.\n",

We’ve been thinking a lot about how to do just that with the launch of the  Millions Learning Real-time Scaling Labs starting in Brazil, Jordan, Tanzania, Côte d’Ivoire, and the U.S. city of Philadelphia. How do we balance and give equal weight to our three primary objectives: learn from, document, and support education interventions in the process of scaling? We think that drawing from principles behind adaptive and iterative learning methodologies, such as improvement science, can help.\t\n",

      "Our starting point with the scaling labs is to learn more about how effective education interventions expand and deepen their impact—what we refer to as scale—especially among some of the world’s most marginalized communities. The global education community is learning a lot about how best to scale, some of which is seen in our 2016 report Millions Learning: Scaling Up Quality Education in Developing Countries. But there is certainly a lot more to learn, particularly around the core drivers behind adapting an evidenced-based initiative to a new context as well as about the enabling conditions in the environment that allow for good ideas to take root and spread. Through the lab process, we hope to learn even more about this scaling as it unfolds in real-time.\n",
      "Secondly, we hope to document this process so that we gain deeper insight into the scaling journey, not only to understand what outcomes are achieved but, just as importantly, to understand how they are achieved, and to be able to “tell the story of what happened” so that other decisionmakers can learn from it. We are thinking a lot about how best to capture and share this insight in an actionable way to help inform future policy, financing, and programmatic decisions around scaling in education.\n",
      "And the final leg of the stool is helping to support scaling efforts at the center of the Real-time Scaling Labs. Rather than merely learning from and documenting what is happening as external, silent observers, instead we are co-creating a peer-to-peer, iterative learning approach with partner institutions around the world to actively support the scaling process. During the three to four-year long lab process, we will routinely convene a diversity of stakeholders involved in the initiative(s) to identify scaling goals, develop and/or refine scaling action plans, and engage in a participatory and iterative process of implementing the scaling plan, reflecting on progress, and making course corrections along the way. The intention is to help strengthen capacity to scale among decision-makers through this participatory and applied research approach.\n",
      "In designing these Real-time Scaling Labs, we certainly didn’t start from scratch. We spent the past year researching a wide range of adaptive learning and collective impact approaches and considering how these methodologies might be applied to challenges around scaling in global education. One of the most useful approaches that we have drawn from is improvement science, a user-centered, problem-driven, iterative approach designed to accelerate learning-by-doing. Originally pioneered in the healthcare field by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, improvement science uses iterative cycles to rapidly test change ideas, and adjust based on data in a systemic rigorous way. I had the opportunity to attend the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching’s annual Summit on Improvement in Education earlier this month in San Francisco. At the conference, I heard about three key components of improvement science that really resonated with what we are trying to create with the scaling labs.\n",
      "1. Possibly incorrect and definitely incomplete\n",
      "Improvement science begins with the notion that the ideas we wish to test about how to improve education are possibly incorrect and definitely incomplete, and so will need to be reconsidered, adapted, and possibly even abandoned as we learn more. This notion is also at the core of the Real-time Scaling Labs, recognizing that scaling is not a linear process but is, in fact, cyclical, with ongoing challenges to overcome and opportunities to seize. We recognize that the first plan developed to scale an education intervention will most certainly not be the final one; it must change and be adapted throughout the process of scaling. Therefore, if we want to scale effectively and sustainably, we must continue to assess and adapt our strategies in response to ongoing changes that occur within any complex system, reacting to real-time learning rather than strictly adhering to our first assumptions. This underscores the importance of taking a flexible approach to designing, delivering, and financing interventions for scale. Part of this is also recognizing that setbacks will be an unavoidable and important part of the journey as they are critical moments to learn.\n",
      "2. Every system is perfectly designed to get the results that it gets\n",
      "Improvement science recognizes that we don’t exist in silos and vacuums. If we want to affect large-scale change, we must start by focusing on the broader system and understanding what in the system is producing the outcomes we currently see. Similarly, the scaling labs begin by convening a diverse group of stakeholders in-person to discuss and assess the nature of the problem the intervention(s) seeks to address and the system that produces it. By taking a systems approach, we are able to understand and address the processes and mechanisms within the system that are hindering the type of improvement we seek and to tackle the underlying causes behind the problems we are trying to solve. Additionally, by deliberately engaging a diverse composition of participants in the labs, we recognize the importance of getting multiple perspectives, as one person can only see part of the system.\n",

      "3. Control urges for solutionitis\n",
      "Before jumping to any conclusions about a potential solution, improvement science requires asking deeper questions about the data to truly understand the actual problem to be solved. An excellent speaker in one of the sessions I attended gave the example of the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials, which were decaying at an increasingly rapid rate. Evidence suggested it was a result of the cleaning process. Rather than rushing to make changes, improvement science led to asking why the monuments were cleaned so frequently and with such harsh chemicals. They found the frequent cleaning was to remove the large amount of bird droppings on the memorials. Why were so many birds flying over? Because of a large spider population on the memorials attracting the pigeons as food sources. And why so many spiders? Because of gnats swarming the monuments at dusk. And why so many gnats? They were drawn by the lighting of the monuments. This series of deep questions led to the decision to turn on the memorial lights one hour later, after sunset, eliminating the root cause of the problem (gnats). This will also be a core tenant of the scaling labs, as we will not be satisfied with identifying scaling challenges and opportunities to leverage at a surface level and jumping immediately to finding solutions, but rather will spend time to collectively understand the root causes and ensure our scaling plans seek to take those into account.\n",

And, increasingly, corporations and governments are collecting, analyzing, and sharing detailed information about individuals over extended periods of time. While these vast quantities of data from new sources and novel methods for large-scale data analysis promise to yield a deeper understanding of individuals’ characteristics, behavior, and relationships, they also create heightened risks of misuse.\n",

      "Our research analyzes how informational risks multiply as more frequent and longer-term personal data collections combine with increasingly broad accumulations of data that include dozens or even thousands of attributes. Broad, long-term data collection greatly increases risk because collecting data from the same individual repeatedly leaves behavioral “fingerprints” that make it much easier to re-identify individuals in the data. When repeated measurements are combined with broad data collections, the data can also provide insights into domains of activity that stray far from the intended purpose of the data collection.\n",
      "These risks have outpaced corporate data privacy safeguards in current use. For example, consider how one of the largest corporate data brokers recently evaluated a potential new data product:\n",
      "“Acxiom’s analytics team had developed a model of ‘10,000 audience propensities’ derived primarily from product purchasing data. Although no healthcare data was collected, these propensities included personal predictive scores for a number of sensitive health attributes such as ‘vaginal itch scores’ and ‘erectile dysfunction scores.’ When the leadership team met to discuss whether the use of such scores would be perceived as too invasive, a member of the team, the company’s Global Policy and Privacy officer, came prepared to read the actual scores on these sensitive topics for each of the individuals in the room. When confronted with the problem in this direct, personal way, the leadership team decided that certain scores were ‘too sensitive’ and should not be made available as a product to its customers. The officer later testified that had she not brought to light her concerns in such a compelling way, the leadership team likely would have made a different decision regarding the use of the scores at issue.”\n",
      "This real-world example illustrates how big data may be used in ways that were not anticipated at the time of collection, and how corporate data protection can critically depend on ad hoc, “gut” judgments by a small number of decisionmakers based on their opinions about unspecified social norms. Indeed, although Acxiom showed restraint in this particular instance, other companies have reached very different conclusions regarding the appropriateness of selling similar types of highly sensitive information about individuals. Other data brokers have made decisions to sell lists of names of rape victims, addresses of domestic violence shelters, and names of individuals suffering from various health conditions, including genetic diseases, dementia, and HIV/AIDS.\n",

      "Consumers deserve better. In general, sensitive personal information is subject to substantially stronger protections when collected and used in the course of academic research.

      "Further, while controls are generally stronger in academia, we find that traditional approaches to safeguarding privacy are being stretched to the limit by broad and frequent data collections. To manage these risks, we recommend adopting technologies emerging from computer science research which enable sophisticated controls on computation, inference, and use.\n",
      "Controls on computation limit the direct operations that can be meaningfully performed on data. Emerging approaches include secure multiparty computation, functional encryption, homomorphic encryption, and secure public ledgers (e.g., blockchain technologies). Controls on inference limit how much can be learned from computations about the constituent components of the database, e.g., records, individuals, or groups. Increasingly, differentially private mechanisms are being used to provide strong limits on inferences specific to individuals in the data. Controls on use limit the domain of human activity in which computations and inferences are used. Personal data stores and the executable policies they incorporate are emerging technical approaches to control use.\n",
      "Privacy is not the inevitable price of technology. In many cases these emerging technologies can provide better privacy than traditional privacy controls, while preserving or increasing the accuracy of data analysis. Nevertheless, there are many unresolved challenges for both traditional and emerging methods used to protect data that are broad and collected frequently. When dealing with these types of data, it is especially important to continually review and adapt practices, including a combination of legal, computational, and procedural controls, to address new risks and provide stronger data privacy protection.\n",

As noted in the recent book, “The Future of Work:  Robots, AI, and Automation,” there are exciting advances in finance, transportation, national defense, smart cities, and health care, among other areas. Businesses are developing solutions that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations and using these tools to improve the way their firms function.\n",
      "Yet there also are concerns about the impact of these developments on jobs and personal privacy. A Pew Research Center national survey revealed considerable unease about emerging trends. It found that 65 percent of American adults think that in 50 years, robots and computers “will do much of the work currently done by humans.”1 A 2018 Brookings survey found that 49 percent on adult online users worry AI will reduce personal privacy and 38 percent fear it will cut the number of jobs.\n",
      "Search interest in both AI and robotics correlated with major research breakthroughs.\n",
      "In this paper, we look at views of AI, robots, and automation using internet search data. This report is the third in a series of big data analysis that charts long terms trends in online search trends. Our first report focused on views about Donald Trump in his first year as president, while our second one  examined views about American democracy.2\n",

      "Search interest in both AI and robotics correlated with major research breakthroughs. A pair of Facebook AIs developed their own language to communicate, and another study found that humans are more comfortable with error-prone robots. News of these developments was associated with search interest in AI.\n",
      "Artificial intelligence and robotics are also being tested outside the laboratory. The Amazon Go convenience store uses AI to track customer purchases, while a growing number of companies are testing self-driving vehicles on public roads. Reports of fatal accidents in recent months highlighted the potential hazards of testing new technology.\n",
      "News that Cambridge Analytica accessed Facebook user data without authorization raised search interest in online privacy. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, which came into effect this month, also is associated with greater search activities around AI.\n",

      "\tThe analysis of Google search trends has increased in recent years. Seth Stephens-Davidowitz used Google search trends to investigate how much racial animus cost Barack Obama in terms of votes during the 2008 and 2012 elections.3 Google search trends were especially useful in that study as traditional survey results asking white individuals whether they would vote for a black president may have masked an actual reluctance to do so.\n",
      "Google search data also have been used to examine the agenda setting effects of television and newspaper coverage. Brian Weeks and Brian Southwell studied news coverage of the rumor that Obama was secretly a Muslim.4 By examining search trends prior to 2007, they demonstrated that the volume of news coverage of this rumor positively predicted aggregate Google searches of that idea.\n",
      "Event histories and methodology\n",
      "Event histories help to make sense of longitudinal data. Matching events that correspond to spikes in interest enable researchers to add context to the aggregate information. For example, company announcements or government actions often drive media and public interest in particular topics. The media report high-profile activities and the public responds by requesting information related to those events. Seeing the ups and downs in search behavior and matching those data points to actual events provides clues regarding the factors driving public interest.\n",
      "From the standpoint of technology, the past year has been quite eventful.\n",
      "From the standpoint of technology, the past year has been quite eventful. Research and development in AI and robotics produced Facebooks bots that created their own language to communicate and a Boston Dynamics robot that could open a door on its own. Amazon opened its Amazon Go convenience store to the public in January. Instead of cashiers, the store employs an array of cameras and artificial intelligence to track customer purchases and charge their Amazon accounts. March saw two fatal crashes involving semi-autonomous vehicles: An Uber car struck a pedestrian in Arizona and the driver of a Tesla hit a highway median in California. In April, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared before both chambers of Congress to answer questions related to the sharing of user data with Cambridge Analytica.\n",
      "In this analysis, we use Google search queries and event histories to examine trends in views about technology over the past year. The data come from Google searches of the U.S. web between April 23, 2017 and April 27, 2018, and we use weekly search data to smooth the data into regular time intervals.\n",
      "The topics analyzed include interest in artificial intelligence, robots, automation, jobs, and privacy. According to Google Trends, interest is defined as “search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. Likewise a score of 0 means the term was less than 1% popular as the peak.”5\n",
      "We focus on Google search because it includes 88 percent of the searches that take place in the United States, compared to 7 percent for Bing and 4 percent for Yahoo.6 It is important to note that since data are aggregated, it is not possible to break them down by age, gender, race, or other categories of possible interest. According to Google, its search data are normalized in order to facilitate comparability based on subject, time period, and location.\n",
      "For a given search term, Google Trends data note that its information represents “an unbiased sample of Google search data. Only a percentage of searches are used to compile Trends data.” Our data was collected on April 28, 2018, which means that trend data analyzed at other points in time could yield different results.\n",
      "Interest in artificial intelligence, robots, and automation\n",
      "One of the highest peaks in interest in AI occurred in April when the European Union announced plans to launch its own AI research hub to compete with China and the United States. The U.S. is home to many technology companies working on various applications for AI, supplemented by academic researchers at leading universities. China has also announced a massive increase in funding for its own AI efforts. The EU announcing its own initiative shows the strategic importance of artificial intelligence.\n",
      "One of the highest peaks in interest in AI occurred in April when the European Union announced plans to launch its own AI research hub to compete with China and the United States.\n",
      "Peak interest in robots occurred in January 2018 during the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where many technology companies debut new products for market or new technology in development. Robots displayed there include Sophia, a humanoid robot that can walk and talk. With greater use of sensors and artificial intelligence to gather and process information, robots are capable of a greater number of tasks. Boston Dynamics posted a video of a robot that could grasp a doorknob and open a door for another robot to pass through.\n",
      "Search interest also peaked in March, around the time an autonomous Uber test vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Ariz. Less than a week later, a crash also killed the driver of a Tesla in autonomous mode in Mountain View, Calif. These setbacks in driverless car testing raise the stakes for the technology: Any failures could cost lives, but success could save many more.\n",
      "The highest interest in automation took place in October 2017, when Tesla announced that it would produce an all-electric semi-truck with its autonomous driving capability. Self-driving trucks could have major impacts on the work of 1.8 million truck drivers in the U.S. Some may transition to remotely managing fleets of autonomous trucks, or they may continue riding in trucks to navigate them through crowded cities. Driving for long stretches of time also makes trucking a relatively dangerous occupation, so autonomous vehicles could reduce fatigue and other hazards of the job.\n",

      "Search volume for privacy remained steady throughout the year until the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke in late March of this year. The data analysis firm created a Facebook app that gathered data not just on its users, but also on friends in their network without their consent. Over two days of congressional hearings, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg answered questions about how his company handles user data and what changes will prevent unauthorized sharing of data in the future. Weeks later, Facebook posted record profits and Cambridge Analytica field for bankruptcy.\n",

      "Conclusions\n",
      "To summarize, there were a number of major spikes in public interest in AI, robots, and automation over the past year. News stories about research breakthroughs in laboratories as well as real-world applications of artificial intelligence and robotics drove search interest in these technologies. Peaks in searches for news about jobs and privacy coincided respectively with reports about jobs numbers and Cambridge Analytica collecting data on Facebook users without their consent. Comparing the two groups of search terms, interest in jobs broadly correlates with interest in AI, robots, and automation, while privacy broadly correlates with AI. For better or worse, these technologies could have a major impact on the number and types of jobs that exist in the future. Artificial intelligence can make decisions based on collected personal information with important consequences for privacy. We expect AI, robots, and automation to continue to drive interest in jobs and privacy into the future.\n",
      "News stories about research breakthroughs in laboratories as well as real-world applications of artificial intelligence and robotics drove search interest in these technologies.\n",
      "It is important, of course, to keep in mind the limits of internet search data. First, they are highly aggregated, and it is not possible to break down the overall numbers by age, gender, race, or other important demographic categories. Second, they measure interest in a topic, but not the direction of sentiment. Third, search data are sensitive to the terms being queried.\n",
      "Those points notwithstanding, though, internet search data rest on trillions of data points, provide information in real time, and measure trends over time. That helps analysts explore important topics such as views of democracy during the first year of Trump’s presidency and discern shifts in interest based on subject and time. As such, they represent a valuable technique for the exploration of contemporary developments.\n",

      "URL: Is college choice impacted by data in the College Scorecard?\n",
      "TITLE: \n",
      "National Decision Day—the day thousands of high school students finalize their college plans—is around the corner.  Colleges want to know whether students will attend their institution and after the dust settles, they also want to know how students arrived at those decisions.  Getting inside a teenager’s head is both scary and critical for education policy.  Research has shown that, nationally, approximately 41 percent of prospective college students enroll in a college that is of lower academic quality than they could attend (“under-match”).  This is of concern because attending lower academic quality institutions may decrease the likelihood that students will persist to graduation and, as one well-known study points out, the benefits of a high academic quality education do not necessarily come at an increased cost.  So why do high schoolers make seemingly sub-optimal educational decisions? \n",
      "One potential explanation for under-matching may be that students do not have the information they need in order to make thoughtful decisions about where to apply to college. In an effort to address this issue head-on, the U.S. Department of Education released a new version of the College Scorecard on September 12, 2015. The College Scorecard highlights each college’s annual cost, average graduation rate, and median earnings among students 10 years after enrolling.  With the exception of median earnings, this information was previously available to students from sources such as US News and World Report’s college rankings.  The appeal of the median earnings data, the easy-to-read format on the Department of Education’s College Scorecard website, and surrounding media attention may have impacted how some students have made college application decisions this year.\n",
      "Since its release in the fall, scholars have critiqued the content of the College Scorecard and whether it will hold colleges accountable for their students’ successes and failures, but, until now, there has been no evidence about how this information affects high school students’ choices about college.  In a paper released last week, two researchers at the College Board, Michael Hurwitz and Jonathan Smith, provide the first evidence of how the information contained in the College Scorecard has influenced high school seniors.\n",
      "To conduct their analysis, the authors make use of data on SAT “score sends” to a sample of 1600 four-year institutions.  Prospective college students who take the SAT are given the option of sending their scores to four different colleges free of charge (and each additional college for a nominal fee).  Though not all colleges require that students submit SAT scores, these score sends can be treated as a proxy for where students are applying to college.  For students graduating from high school between 2010 and 2016, the authors document college-specific trends in score send timing and volume.  Then they estimate the effect of the availability of the College Scorecard data on score sending behavior by comparing trends before and after September 2015.  The authors argue that the new data on median earnings influenced SAT score sending, but found no such effects for annual costs and average graduation rates, both of which were available prior to the College Scorecard’s release.\n",
      "Overall, the authors find that a 10 percent increase in a college’s reported median earnings boosts score sends by 2.4 percent. However, this overall elasticity estimate conceals the variation in student responsiveness by type of high school and student demographics.  For example, the number of score sends from students enrolled in private high schools increases by 4.1 percent with each 10 percent increase in a college’s median earnings. Responsiveness to the College Scorecard is also stronger among Asian and White students compared to Black and Hispanic students. Taken as a whole, the results of this paper demonstrate that the biggest responders to the College Scorecard data are the same students who enter the college application process with the most resources and information to make sound college enrollment decisions.\n",
      "Though the authors carefully document variation in responsiveness to the College Scorecard across a range of student subgroups, the paper is unable to explain what is driving these differential effects.   On the one hand, the differential responsiveness may occur because well-resourced students are better prepared to access and make use of the College Scorecard. On the other hand, it could be that different types of students viewed the College Scorecard at the same rate but only the well-resourced students changed their behavior in response to the information.  After all, other research has shown that the majority of high school graduates enrolling in college attend an institution within 20 miles of their home.  More research is needed to better understand why some types of students appear to be more responsive to the College Scorecard data than others.  Otherwise, the College Scorecard runs the paradoxical risk of exacerbating inequities in college choice and under-matching through the provision of more information.\n",

      "To conduct their analysis, the authors make use of data on SAT “score sends” to a sample of 1600 four-year institutions.  Prospective college students who take the SAT are given the option of sending their scores to four different colleges free of charge (and each additional college for a nominal fee).  Though not all colleges require that students submit SAT scores, these score sends can be treated as a proxy for where students are applying to college.  For students graduating from high school between 2010 and 2016, the authors document college-specific trends in score send timing and volume.  Then they estimate the effect of the availability of the College Scorecard data on score sending behavior by comparing trends before and after September 2015.  The authors argue that the new data on median earnings influenced SAT score sending, but found no such effects for annual costs and average graduation rates, both of which were available prior to the College Scorecard’s release.\n",
      "Overall, the authors find that a 10 percent increase in a college’s reported median earnings boosts score sends by 2.4 percent. However, this overall elasticity estimate conceals the variation in student responsiveness by type of high school and student demographics.  For example, the number of score sends from students enrolled in private high schools increases by 4.1 percent with each 10 percent increase in a college’s median earnings. Responsiveness to the College Scorecard is also stronger among Asian and White students compared to Black and Hispanic students. Taken as a whole, the results of this paper demonstrate that the biggest responders to the College Scorecard data are the same students who enter the college application process with the most resources and information to make sound college enrollment decisions.\n",
      "Though the authors carefully document variation in responsiveness to the College Scorecard across a range of student subgroups, the paper is unable to explain what is driving these differential effects.   On the one hand, the differential responsiveness may occur because well-resourced students are better prepared to access and make use of the College Scorecard. On the other hand, it could be that different types of students viewed the College Scorecard at the same rate but only the well-resourced students changed their behavior in response to the information.  After all, other research has shown that the majority of high school graduates enrolling in college attend an institution within 20 miles of their home.  More research is needed to better understand why some types of students appear to be more responsive to the College Scorecard data than others.  Otherwise, the College Scorecard runs the paradoxical risk of exacerbating inequities in college choice and under-matching through the provision of more information.\n",
